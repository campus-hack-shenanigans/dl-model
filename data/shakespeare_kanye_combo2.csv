For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats

Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I dont never drive it
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones

Sing along with me yall
Welcome brave earl into our territories:
Exeunt

The Prince of Wales from such a field as this

If I could see them.
O what a scandal is it to our crown
You trippin when you aint sippin have a refill
Which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it:

And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer
I have awhile given truce unto my wars
Before you ask
Even when I blow doja

And I never let a nigga get that close to me
But this aint bout that
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
Had been alive this hour
He said Man I dont know. Maybe a miracle
I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
Then I get there and all the Popeyes is finished girl
Run back to their arms

And yet in faith thou bear'st thee like a king:
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye

Redeeming time when men think least I will.
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell

Enter POINS
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:
Exeunt

You choose you choose

Of horsemen that were levied for this siege!

A hot temper matched with a cold killer

On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.

Stay stay I say!
I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
Strike down with them cut the villains' throats:
For none but Samsons and Goliases
You aint built like that
I got a problem with spendin before I get it
You really want to know about a day in that shit
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Yallll be back together in a day or two
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
The pressure the problem aint I be drivin
have named uncertain the time itself unsorted and
Girl told you dont leave his ass
Her allure is more couture tailormade
I thought I had a sign a Seal like Heidi Klum
Look how we can or sad or merrily
But now I do respect thee as my soul.
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing?
No goodbyes
It may not be.
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
But I couldnt figure out who Id wanna take
Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
To see what friends are living who are dead.
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Early morning cartoon shit black
‘Cause when she leave your ass she gon leave with half
gentleman: they will along with company for they
Well lets kill all the parlayin and offer you a cosmopolitan
The tongues of soothers but a braver place
Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!

But now thy uncle is removing hence:
Like a flight with no visa
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on

You get to flirtin play her just perfect
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
Right now my car and home would be repod
You talking bout Brenda?
And now I fear that fatal prophecy
Exeunt
But to you Im Rick James bitch
Pinkass polos with a fuckin backpack
I do not think a braver gentleman
Even though I knew he never told the truth
My lord where are you? what devise you on?
I know its late and I took all year but
I had the strangest feeling lately
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
by boy servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
I'll grow less for I'll purge and leave sack and
No nor you shall not.
Then maybe Ill be able to give her dick all the time
Hold up let me hit you with this
But yet I would your father had been here.
Just forget it you talk it I live it
Yeah you wasnt mine though
O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
And we dont care what people say
Mademoiselle got a hell of a Black tail
I see the blood on the leaves
O I should have a heavy miss of thee
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
To make us strangers to his looks of love.
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Brother the king hath made your nephew mad.
In rage dismiss'd my father from the court
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
Now I aint saying you a gold digger you got needs
That yall its like that yall
God Im willing
Who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up
Im insulted you should go head
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs

Hopping out the van screams from the fans

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
And wash away thy country's stained spots.
So you had need for Orleans is besieged
Surely by all the glory you have won
Not to shabby
Coco Rocha Kate Mimosa
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
No sins as long as theres permission
I got seniority with the sororities
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven
It would amaze the proudest of you all.
Prisoner! to whom?
A perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off:
Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
Alarum: excursions wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemmed about and TALBOT rescues him
His valour shown upon our crests to-day
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
But only I could come up with some shit like this
Lets play the blame game
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
And unbound the rest and then come in the other.
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
I see the blood on the leaves
And free my country from calamity:
Life is a marathon
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
Well thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou

Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
Excuse me but this verse
The very bottom and the soul of hope
Disgraced me in my happy victories
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen
These niggas read the pimp manual but I designed it
So I need the bread or an Excedrin
There's enough to make us all.
I saw a recent picture of her I guess she was right
The edge of war like an ill-sheathed knife
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
And Im feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive

And hemm'd about with grim destruction:
To be a public spectacle to all:

Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Courts sucked me dry I spent that bread

Was it something I did wrong?
To be so pester'd with a popinjay
There is no hope that ever I will stay
Yes Mr. Wests turn that new child rebel
But still supported me when I did the opposite
No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
It is too late I cannot send them now:
For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
When you stop the programs for after school
A letter was deliver'd to my hands
Nay my lord he called you Jack and said he would
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
Where is my strength my valour and my force?

Might have caught you clappin every Sunday at church
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
They say Damn Yeezy Yeezy you dont know us no more?
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Then I perceive that will be verified
By my consent we'll even let them alone.
Why what a candy deal of courtesy
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Doin clothes you would have thought I had help
When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck
But I go so hard I could make it melt
Audacious cruelty. If that the king

Some of us love you well and even those some
We aint dissing you

Of such as your oppression feeds upon

He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:
What! am I dared and bearded to my face?
To line his enterprise: but if you go--
In some relations youre just supposed to say none
Did you beg any? God forbid!
Take it line for line
Look God its the same me
The fraud of England not the force of France
Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Hear me my liege:
Ay Hal 'tis hot 'tis hot there's that will sack a city.
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay

Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Woe is me baby this is tragic
What didst thou lose Jack?
Exit with his soldiers
Until it wither with me to my grave

Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Welcome to the good life where niggas who sell D
Come come and lay him in his father's arms:
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
Nor shall it Harry for the hour is come
To be the princely bride of such a lord

Within the Temple-hall we were too loud
The best way that you know the best way that you know how

Why what is he? as good a man as York.

Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?

To the hustlers killers murderers drug dealers even the scrippers
A base Walloon to win the Dauphin's grace

See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Dont know why but I know a sign when I see it
You niggas pussy aint me

Well urged my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince
Between two horses which doth bear him best
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.

Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
To be deposed and shortly murdered.

After all these longass verses
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
And pray that all of their pain be champagne
He bears him on the place's privilege
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
And comes not in o'er-ruled by prophecies
You up? You been good?
Never to England shall he bear his life
But yall cant hold me down like restraint
I go to certify her Talbot's here.
Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:
Go hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up

Forward by nature enemy to peace
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders

But that I think his father loves him not
Take my number and lock it in
When he was personal in the Irish war.

So doth the swan her downy cygnets save
And I am lowted by a traitor villain
The king himself in person is set forth
In faith it is exceedingly well aim'd.
Stay go do what you will the like do I

To give me hearing what I shall reply.

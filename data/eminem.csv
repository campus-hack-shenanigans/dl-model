Peace to Thirstin Howl A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth
Im just a nerd cursed wit badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth
So Im here to rule the planet startin wit your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
Wit smeard letters runnin together in blurred spurts
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers
My first words were Bleep bleep and Curse curse
Never had ish and I still dont deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and Im on my third Certs
Yankin out my stitches hollering Nurse nurse!
You said this shot would numb it trick it just hurts worse!
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
And its like that and its like that
Evidence
Got no apathy
Yo I Platform my strategy mix words in alchemy
Evidence I wont get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I Ill tell you heres the diff
Gun to your head youre dead pointblank I shapeshift
Thats right to deardeer anelope or owl
In life use your potential or Steve Howe
Im about to call it quits yo too much weightll break your rack mount
The manll make you move yo so make your move a backout
You say I use my name too much as a clutch
Try holdin on to beat instead of pushin on your crutch
Flipped it backwards Evidence attack nerds off the head
Steadfast right or left dont matter see you comin 
DeafDef like Leppards pop the piece I be the sheppard
Causin the herd the name is Ev absurd
Verbs get flipped its like this yo acronyms and all that
Methaphor imagery you claimin metaphors and spittin similies
Not havin It the name is Evidence
Like Pos. K gibbin the life thinkin of stabbin it
Skills prevail you possess take no offense
But dont profess lies within your mind tempt and stress
Iriscience
Its like uh-oh-oh
Its Dilated Peoples on the Wake Up Show-uh-oh
We kick a lick or some for the radio-uh-oh
Yo CaTashTrophic like Rico fades out
eminem and dilated peoples freestyleMiscellaneousI reckon you aint familiar with these here parts
You know theres a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldnt stop em quickest damn gun slinger Ive ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood that ol saloon there was their lil home
Away from home they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live
In that tavern and on a quiet night you can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine
I dont speak I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
Im not a real person Im a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And a noise is bred picked up and transmitted through Royces head
Trapped him in his room possessed him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side he made a choice and said
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which onell swerve first
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil intelligence level is hellier than
Treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal Im not a fair man disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missiles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked its like the Nazis in the nations
Collaborating attemptin to take over the earth
Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
Hes evil and Im bad like Steve Segal
Above the law cuz I dont agree wit police either
We aint eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle
I breathe ether in three amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
Hes insane no Im not I just want to shoot up
And Im pissed off cuz I cant find a decent vain
The disaster wit dreads
Im bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after Im dead
When in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
Serve this lobbyist strangle your body then confirm you
Whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws
Wit my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass
Im blazin MCs at the same time amazin MCs
Somehow MCs aint that eye-brow raisin to me
From all of angles of us flash a mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt
Hello? Billy aiyyo whats up
Were comin to get you
Stop they know its us
I used to be a loudmouth remember me?
Im the one who burned your house down
Well Im out now and this time
Im comin back to blow your house up
And I aint gone leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you wont see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and Im gettin ready to leave
Ima put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
Hes Evil and Im Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful see you in hell for the sequel
Well be waitin See you in hell
Wall Street Royce Da Five-Nine Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel bye bye
Bad meets evil what? Till next time
And so thats the story when bad meets evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
Its too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin out of that ol saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Wait did yall hear that?
bad meets evilThe Slim Shady LPLately Ive been hard to reach
Ive been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Im reaching out for you
Im just so fucking depressed
I just cant seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And in order for me to pick the mic back up
I dont know how or why or when
I ended up this position Im in
Im starting to feel dissin again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just cant admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow
But I cant just sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact
Ill be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
Ill be one tough act to follow
Here today gone tomorrow
But youd have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes just to see
What its like to be me
Ill be you lets trade shoes
Just to see what itd be like
To feel your pain you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what wed find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Dont let em say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So dont let em say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
I think Im starting to lose my sense of humor
Everythings so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in its like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation like I want that
Im not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I dont need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of em aint even funny like
Ha! Marshall youre so funny man
You should be a comedian god damn!
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why dont you all sit down
Listen to the tale Im about to tell
Hell we dont gotta trade our shoes
And you aint gotta walk no thousand miles
In my shoes just to see
What its like to be me
Ill be you lets trade shoes
Just to see what itd be like
To feel your pain you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what wed find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Dont let em say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So dont let em say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands were dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip em dont expect no help
Now I couldve either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which Im placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
Every single place every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and itll get stuck like that
Meanwhile Im just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that
Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At  years old
I learned my lesson then
Cause I wasnt trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where youre sittin
Its probably % different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear s
Lets see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes just to see
What its like to be me
Ill be you lets trade shoes
Just to see what itd be like
To feel your pain you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what wed find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Dont let em say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So dont let em say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So dont let em say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So
Lately Ive been hard to reach
Ive been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Im reaching out for you
Yeah to my babies
Stay strong daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you shoes to fit you
So put em on and wear em
Be yourself man be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Dont ever let anyone tell you you aint beautiful
beautifulRelapse.

But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad

Dear Slim I wrote you but you still aint callin
I left my cell my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways fuck it
Whats been up man hows your daughter?
My girlfriends pregnant too
Im out to be a father
If I have a daughter guess what Im a call her?
Im a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too Im sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didnt want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But Im your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam
I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours your biggest fan
This is Stan
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I?

And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad

Dear Slim you still aint called or wrote
I hope you have the chance I aint mad
I just think its fucked up you dont answer fans
If you didnt want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didnt have to
But you couldve signed an autograph for Matthew
Thats my little brother man
Hes only  years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For  hours and you just said No
Thats pretty shitty man
Youre like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do
I aint that mad though I just dont like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you you would write back
See Im just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre sayin in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put em on
Cause I dont really got shit else
So that shit helps when Im depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
Its like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriends jealous
Cause I talk about you 
But she dont know you like
I know you Slim no one does
She dont know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
Youve gotta call me man
Ill be the biggest fan youll ever lose
Sincerely yours Stan
P.S. We should be together too
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad

Dear Mister Im too good to call or write my fans
Thisll be the last package I ever send your ass

I dont deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on em perfect
So this is my cassette Im sending you
I hope you hear it
Im in the car right now
Im doing  on the freeway
Hey Slim I drink a fifth of vodka
Ya dare me to drive?
You know this song by Phil Collins
From the air in the night
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didnt then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him
Thats kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now its too late
Im on a thousand downers now Im drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim we could have been together
Think about it you ruined it now
I hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you cant sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you cant breathe without me
See Slim Shut up bitch!
Im trying to talk
Hey Slim thats my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didnt slit her throat I just tied her up
See I aint like you
Cause if she suffocates shell suffer more
And then shell die too
Well gotta go
Im almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad

Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner
But Ive just been busy
You said your girlfriends pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look Im really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And heres an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on your starter cap
Im sorry I didnt see you at the show
I must have missed you
Dont think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And whats this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin dawg
Cmon how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counselin
To help your ass from bouncin off the walls
When you get down some
And whats this shit about us
Meant to be together?
That type of shitll make me not want us
To meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that youll be doin just fine
If youd relax a little
Im glad I inspire you
But Stan why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just dont want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didnt say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was it was you! Damn!

Yeah I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey what daddy always tell you? Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip what you cryin about? You got me
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When Im gone but Im tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry
Cause youre scared I aint there daddys with you in your prayers
No more cryin wipe them tears daddys here no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it we gon do it Laney
Uncles crazy aint he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Were all we got it this world when it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze I know its confusin you
Daddys always on the move mamas always on the news
I try to keep up sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us I dont see us ever
Bein together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be but its just somethin
That we have no control over and thats what destiny is
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and thisll all just be a dream
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddys here to hold you through the night
I know mommys not here right now
And we dont know why we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise mommas gon be alright
Heh its funny I remember back one year
When daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck em under the tree
And said some of em were from me
Cause daddy couldnt buy em
Ill never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
And thats when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein daddy on the TV
And momma didnt like it and you and Laney were too young
To understand that papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now Im sittin in this empty house just reminiscin lookin
At your baby pictures it just trips me out to see how much
You both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
Wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
Laney Im talkin to you too daddys still here
I like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it?
Shh mommas only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddys here to hold you through the night
I know mommys not here right now
And we dont know why we feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise mommas gon be alright
And if you ask me to
Daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird Ima give you the world
Ima buy a diamond ring for you Ima sing for you
Ill do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird dont sing
And that ring dont shine Ima break that birdies neck
Id go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat dont fuck with dad ha ha
mockingbirdEncore.
Em its Paul listen
Joel just called me and he told me
Youre in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like its a shooting range
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around like an idiot
Outside of your home youre gonna get yourself in trouble
Dont bring your gun outside of your home you cant carry it on you
Leave your fucking gun at home
paul rosenberg skitThe Eminem Show.
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world
So come and kill me while my names hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot
Think Ive got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot
Stop they blood flow til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy I told you that I cant stop
Gotta make em fear you before you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or Ima come and kill you
I got mushrooms I got acid I got tabs and aspirin tablets
Im your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me Im your friend when you need a mini thin Slim Shady
Im Shady
I like happy things Im really calm and peaceful
I like birds bees I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out took a see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I dont want to just die a normal death I wanna be killed twice
How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When theyre high off of drugs they havent even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife she ever saw in her life
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school

May I have your attention please?
Will The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
Were gonna have a problem here
Yall act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin her ass worse than before
They first were divorce throwin her over furniture
Its the return of the Ah wait no way youre kidding
He didnt just say what I think he did did he?
And Dr. Dre said nothing you idiots
Dr. Dres dead hes locked in my basement!
Feminist women love Eminem
Chigga chigga chigga Slim shady Im sick of him
Look at him walkin around grabbin his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who yeah but hes so cute though!
Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than whats goin on in your parents bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose but cant
But its cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
And if Im lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And thats the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the discovery channel dont they?
We aint nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes
Im slim shady yes Im the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So wont The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up?
Coz Im slim shady yes Im the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So wont The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up?
Will Smith dont gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records
Well I do so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics cant even stomach me let alone stand me
But slim what if you win wouldnt it be weird?
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear em argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch put me on blast on M.T.V
Yeah hes cute but I think hes married to Kim hee-hee!
I should download her audio on MP
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
Im sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And theres a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me who just dont give a fuck like me
Who dress like me walk talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me
Coz Im slim shady yes Im the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So wont The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up?
Coz Im slim shady yes Im the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So wont The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up?
Im like a head trip to listen to cause Im only givin you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of yall and I dont gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
Its funny cause at the rate Im goin when Im thirty
Ill be the only person in the nursin home flirting
Pinchin nurses asses when Im jackin off with jergens
And Im jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isnt working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King spittin on your onion rings
Or in the parkin lot circling screaming I dont give a fuck!
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time loud as you can how does it go?
Im slim shady yes Im the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So wont The Real Slim Shady please stand up

Of what the fuck I can do when Im on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Psych Im spiking you like a football

Pretty mouth and a good jaw

Watch the wood grain dont want no cum stain
Bitch you listening tryna turn me down
Slut Im talking to you turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin

Whats the saying? Where theres thunder theres lightening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate ocassions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That Ive come to smash everything in my path

Okay Im going to attempt to drown myself

You can be just like me
Mic check one two we recordin?
Im cancerous so when I diss you wouldnt wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit me Ima even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
Ohh no so if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt and lately Im on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed take pills drop outta school kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
Im dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So Im dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that Im white ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I dont get pissed yall dont even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white I dont even exist
I get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger wont go down how do I wave?
And this is how Im supposed to teach kids how to behave?
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door must have been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
My mind wont work if my spine dont jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
Im not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
Thatll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap styles warped Im runnin out the morgue
Witcha dead grandmothers corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
Im bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
A main vein with a chainsaw and Im in pain?
I take a breather and sighed either Im high or Im nuts
Cause if you aint tiltin this room neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit its over with
I bought Cages tape opened it and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
Ive been with  women who got HIV
Now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me
role modelThe Slim Shady LPSome days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like Im surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in piss
My lifes like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
Instead of always tryin to swallow it
Instead of starin at this wall and shit
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit
Cant call it shit
All I know is Im about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of moms alcholic fits
This is it last straw thats all thats it
I aint dealin with another fuckin politic
Im like a skillet bubbling until it filters up
Im about to kill it I can feel it buildin up
Blow this buildin up Ive been sealed enough
My cup runneth over I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts?
Well Ima show you what you gon feel my rush
You dont feel it then it must be too real to touch
Peal the dutch Im about to tear shit up
Goosebumps yea Ima make your hair sit up
Yea sit up Ima tell you who I be
Ima make you hate me cause you aint me
You wait it aint too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finders fee
Out this world aint no one out there mind as me
You need piece of mind? Heres a piece of mine
All I needs a line
But sometimes I dont always find the words to rhyme
To express how Im really feelin at that time
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes
Its just sometimes its always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight one-two then half past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
Im desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in this slum cant think of nothin
Fuck Im stumped but wait here comes somethin
Nope its not good enough scribble it out
New pad crinkle it up and throw the shit out
Im fizzlin now thought I figured it out
Balls in my court but Im scared to dribble it out
Im afraid but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Signed out of spit to the grave
Real enough to rill you up
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want
Im a switch hitter bitch Jimmy Smith aint a quitter
Ima sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin boilin point put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed
An MCs worst dream I make em tense
They hate me see me and shake like a chainlink fence
By the looks of em you would swear their jaws was comin
By the screams of em you would swear Im sawin someone
By the way theyre runnin you would swear the law was comin
Its now or never and tonight is all or nothin
Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us he said hed be back
He pinky promised I dont think hes honest
Ill be back baby I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock Ima make em eat this watch
Dont believe me watch Ima win this race
And Ima come back and rub my shit in your face bitch
I found my nitch you gon hear my voice
Til you sick of it you aint gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream til I have half a lung
If I had half a chance Id grab it - Rabbit run
rabbit runMiscellaneousI was born with a dick in my brain yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
Till one night he snuck in and said
Were goin out back I want my dick sucked in the shed
Cant we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
After I fuck you in the butt get some head
Bust a nut get some rest the next day my mother said

The bastard wont even eat nothin hes fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom hes dead
Debbie dont let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fuckin cigarette to his neck
I bet you hes fakin it Ill bet you Ill bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
Ill go handle this of course unless you object?

Then you would know Ive completely lost it
Is he nuts? No hes insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know Ive completely lost it
Is he nuts? No hes insane
Did you get him? Naw the fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fuckin blades off
Ate the blades stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfuckers got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fuckin thing off
Everything cept his tank top and his trainin bra
Aint he raw? Yeah maniac thats Shady Dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta aint he dog?

Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well being
No Dad I said no I dont need no help peein

She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsea
Well this ones called Ass Rape and were shootin the jail scene
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know Ive completely lost it
Is he nuts? No hes insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet

Eminem Part 
Met a retarted kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg
Go to bed with a keg wake up with a forty
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula -D
Forget an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas
Cross the bombest
We blowing up your house
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
Im as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus
Cause I aint making no more threats
Im doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes
On Vietnam war vets
I am more or less sick in the head
Maybe more 
Because I smoked crack today yesterdayand the day before Sabateur
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure
eminem part MiscellaneousAyo before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And baring with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out
Is anybody out there?
It feels like Im talkin  myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin  myself
It feels like Im going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
Yeah
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me Im on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that Im not the only one
I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
What I was going through growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne
Its like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin
I felt horrible about myself he was spittin and I wasnt
Anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God it feels like Im goin psychotic
Thank god that I didnt do it
I would of had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasnt here to see me through it
Im in the booth poppin another pill tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You gon start dissin people for no reason?
Especially when you cant even write a decent punchline even
Youre lying to yourself youre slowly dying youre denying
Your health is declining with your self esteem youre crying out for help
Is anybody out there?
It feels like Im talkin  myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin  myself
It feels like Im going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me Im on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that Im not the only one
Marshall youre no longer the man thats a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is Im wallowin self loathing and hollow
Bottoms up of pill bottle maybe Ill hit my bottom tomorrow
But I must be talkin to the wall though
I dont see nobody else
I guess I keep talkin to myself
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
Ive turned into a hater Ive put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac thats not his motto
Hes not a desperado hes desperate its startin to bottle
Inside em one foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mc Donalds
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
Admit you got a problem your brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isnt them its you you fuckin baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do fuckin Shady
Im fucking going crazy
Is anybody out there?
It feels like Im talkin  myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin  myself
It feels like Im going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me Im on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that Im not the only one
So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin slam before I drown
Hit my bottom so hard I bounce twice suffice this time around
Its different them last two albums didnt count
Encore I was on drugs Relapse I was flushing em out
Ive come up to make it up to you no more fucking around
Ive got something to prove to fans I feel like I let em down
So please accept my apology I finally feel like Im back to normal
I feel like me again let me formally reintroduce myself to you
For those of you who dont know
The new mes back to the old me and homie I dont show no
Signs of slowin up pullin up blowin up all over no mo
My life is no longer a movie but the shows aint over homos
Im back with a vengeance homie Weezy keep ya head up
TI keep ya head up Kanye keep ya head up
Dont let up just keep slayin em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM cause I know what its like
I struggle with this shit every single day
Is anybody out there?
It feels like Im talkin  myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin  myself
It feels like Im going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me Im on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that Im not the only one
So here it is dang this feels like I just woke up or somethin
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was ma
Ay yo is anybody I thought about goin at
Twas never nothin personal
Cause of some shit I was goin thru its everybody else
Im back ay yo
talkin  myselfRecovery.
I take a couple uppers I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
Ive been to mushroom mountain once or twice but whos countin
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
Cool calm just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
Its Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves
I cant describe the vibe I get
When I drive by  people and  I hit ah shit
I started a mosh pit squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce bounce cmon bounce
I said cmon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed I meant coke dumbass sit down
We dont bullshit better ask around
D throws the bomb to gas your town
Bizarre your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out
Fuck that someone help Denaun
Hes upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von you see me steppin on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cos the X is gone
Yeah I took em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone its probably numb
Young dumb and fulla cum
And I think he bout to swallow his tongue
You scary ass it was false alarm
You think Im bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid you so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills blue pills and green big pills
Thats ill
Mescaline
I take a couple uppers I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
Ive been to mushroom mountain once or twice but whos countin
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
Dirty Dozen  of us Shady brothers ladies love us
Thats why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some something something something
Something something something something I dunno
Pop pills pills I pop pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when Im old and gray
Look for coke to smoke no oki dok
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh poor baby born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
Youre crazy
I pop four Es at one time
And I dont need water when Im swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We cant get jobs cos our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack then I might too
Swift chill
I just wanna get high like you
And I dont give a damn if theyre white or blue
Speed shrooms down the valium
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and Im going back soon
I take a couple uppers I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
Ive been to mushroom mountain once or twice but whos countin
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
Im at a rave looking like a slave
High off chronic gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin acid droppin dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline pencil legs wanna try?
Blue pills golden seals
Got Bizarre actin ill drugs kill

These ideas are nightmares for white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearin
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearin
To see him walkin around with his headphones blarin
Alone in his own zone cold and he dont care
Hes a problem child what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out
Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back
Talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants two rags and a stockin cap
His step father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose this house is a broken home
Theres no control he just lets his emotions go
Cmon
Sing with me
Sing
Sing for the year
Sing
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
Cmon
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is danger intertwine it with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum
Only youre unholy only have one homey
Only this gun lonely cuz dont anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
Or they can be great or even worse they can teach hate
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin on corners and porches just rappin
To havin a fortune no more kissin ass
But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you attorneys all gonna turn it to
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
You need to spew dont hesitate to produce air guns
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Swiftly just to get me off these streets quickly
But all their kids been listen to me religiously
So Im signin cds while police fingerprint me
Theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
If Im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense Pete
Its all political if my music is literal and Im a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldnt I wouldnt be fit to
Youre full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you
Sing with me
Sing
Sing for the year
Sing
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
Cmon
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?
Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and Ill get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
And they want to get one cos they think the shits cool
Not knowin were really just protectin ourselves
Were entertainers of course this shits affectin our sales
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
Its fucked up aint it how we can come from practically nothin
To bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
Its why we sing for these kids that dont have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishin they die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
Were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in their eyes
Thats why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it cos we consider these minutes golden
And maybe theyll admit it when were gone
Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can
Sing with me
Sing
Sing for the year
Sing
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
Cmon
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me
Sing
Sing for the year
Sing
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
Cmon
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

There I go
Thinkin of you again
You dont know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin sick to my stomach
Every time I think you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke
I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song woh
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think of
Sixteen bars just aint enough to put some ink to
So fuck it Im a start right here Ill just be briefer
Bout to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldnt go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm but whatever I gonna do?
I go and get another one now I got two
Ooh!
Now Im sittin here with your name on my skin
I cant believe I went and did that stupid shit again
My next girlfriend now her names gotta be Kim
Shit!
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfuckin thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldnt be standin here cryin over you
Ooh!
You dont know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke
I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you probably just shred up yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made stop
And think of how much of a waste itd be for me to put some ink
To a stupid piece of paper Id rather let you see
How much I fuckin hate you in a freestyle
Youre a fuckin cokehead slut I hope you fuckin die
You get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin guts you fuckin slut I hope you die
Die
But please dont get me wrong Im not bitter or mad
Its not that I still love you its not cause I want you back
Its just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack
Aack
But what else can I do I havent got a clue
Now I guess I just move on I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do
Is puke
You dont know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke
Goddamn it
Fuckin bitch
pukeEncore.

Life.. by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret indentities
and disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Moneyll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life?
Im tired of life
Im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
Im tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
Im tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
Im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
Im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why Im smartin off
Im tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
Im tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand Id make the world suck my dick
without a condom on while Im on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough because Id still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
Im tired of being white trash broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
Im tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
Im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Im tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasnt feeling me on Nobodys As Ill As Me
Im tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J-L-B saying Where Hip-Hop Lives
But if I had a million dollars
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand Id make the world suck my dick
without a condom on while Im on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough because Id still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
You know what Im saying?
Im tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
Howm I sposed to be positive when I dont see shit positive?
Know what Im sayin?
I rap about shit around me shit I see
Know what Im sayin? Right now Im tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating thats going on in my own city
Cant get no airplay you know what Im sayin?
But ey its cool though you know what Im sayin?
Just fed up
Thats my word

And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flos quit giving me my ammo
Cant you see why im so mean? if yall leave me alone this wouldnt be my ammo
I wouldnt have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe man i dont know no more

Hailey
Dad
Chorus
Verse 
My songs can make you cry take you by surprise
And at the same time make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
So what youre seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isnt work so its easy to misinterpret it at firstCuz when i speak its tongue in cheek
Id gank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
Id slice my gums get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ices son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time i sung
Like r kelly as soon as bump n grind comes on
More pain inside o my brain in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade standin on ronnys graveScreaming at the sky the clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
And nash briddy musta just stop it
Parents are pissed but the kids love it
Nine millimeter heaters desk and two-seaters with meat cleavers
I dont blame you i wouldnt let hailie listen to me neither
Chorus
Outro

Youre funny daddy!
my dad s gone crazyThe Eminem Show.
Whatever Dre just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo this song is for anyone fuck it
Just shut up and listen aiyyo
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress thats been eatin me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
Peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when Im eatin or feedin my daughter
To not come and speak to me
Speak to me
I dont know you and no
I dont owe you a motherfuckin thing
Im not Mr. NSync Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr. Friendly I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty
Is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Im liftin you  feet in the air
Liftin you  feet
I dont care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of all you
Of all you
I dont mean to be mean
But thats all I can be is just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant
And Oh its his lyrical content the song
Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
Finger at me
So I point one back at em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
When you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
With the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
On Marilyn
Where were the parents at? And look where its at
Middle America now its a tragedy
Now its so sad to see an upper class city
Havin this happenin
This happenin
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way
Rap this way
But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and its burnin and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Im so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top on My Name is
And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock n roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
Got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
Im some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin
The same fuckin questions
Fuckin questions
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in?
The why the who what when the where and the how
Til Im grabbin my hair and Im tearin it out
Cause they drivin me crazy I cant take it
Drivin me crazy
Im racin Im pacin I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get
But I cant take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin by it
No I wont sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole Im glad
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
the way i amThe Marshall Mathers LP.

Well if you want Shady this is what Ill give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka thatll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when Im not co-operating
When Im rockin the table while hes operating
You waited this long now stop debating
Cause Im back Im on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney
But your husbands heart problems complicating
So the FCC wont let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip bum on your lips
Fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready cause this shits about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits fuck you Debbie
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said This looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
Little Hellions kids feelin rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin like prisoners helpless
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary vision of scary
Could start a revolution pollutin the airwaves
A rebel so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin my ass
And its a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well Im back
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then Im gonna
Enter in endin up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
Im interesting the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Heres my ten cents my two cents is free
A nuisance who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said This looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
A-tisket a-tasket I go tit for tat with
Anybody whos talkin this shit that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You  year old baldheaded fag blow me
You dont know me youre too old let go
Its over nobody listen to techno
Now lets go just gimme the signal
Ill be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean Im disgusting
But its just me Im just obscene
No Im not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
Theres a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
Itll be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said This looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

Nice going Shaggy
ken kaniff skitThe Marshall Mathers LP.
I dont understand
Why are you being so mean?
Youre a mean mean man
You are just jealous of me cuz you
You just cant do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me cuz youre a meanie a meanie
But its only cuz youre just really jealous of me
Cuz Im what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things cuz its too easy to see
Youre just a really big weenie big weenie
Alright listen I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
Im going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind your eyes close em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why youre so fuckin jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo? Kitty ka ka poo-poo
Psych Im kidding I just wanted to see if youre still listenin
Okay now I need your undivided attention sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever theres conversation why am I always mentioned?
Ive been dying to ask its been itchin at me is it just because?
You are just jealous of me cuz you
You just cant do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me cuz youre a meanie a meanie
But its only cuz youre just really jealous of me
Cuz Im what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things cuz its too easy to see
Youre just a really big weenie big weenie
Alright now I I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was I fucked up
Psych Im kidding again you idiot no I didnt
Thats just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up aint it?
But I can bust one take without lookin at no paper
Doesnt take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth okay? Youre droolin you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open youre disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir what am I on?
You sir are on truth syrum
Marshall Im so jealous of you please say you wont tell nobody
Id be so embarrassed Im just absolutely terrified
That someones gonna find out why Im saying
All these terrible evil and awful mean things its my own insecurity!
You are just jealous of me cuz you
You just cant do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me cuz youre a meanie a meanie
But its only cuz youre just really jealous of me
Cuz Im what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things cuz its too easy to see
Youre just a really big weenie big weenie
Alright now we were going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cuz thats exactly what your eyes look like want to check to see?
Heres a mirror notice the resemblance here?
Wait let me put these sun glasses on now look in this mirror
How about now? What do you have in common?
Youre both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth this is between me and you
I know youre not happy I know youd much rather see me lying
In the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
Theres no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself its pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this
This is torturous my point is this
That if you say mean things weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is your just is
You are just jealous of me cuz you
You just cant do what I do so instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
About me cuz youre a meanie a meanie
But its only cuz youre just really jealous of me
Cuz Im what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things cuz its too easy to see
Youre just a really big weenie big weenie
Incomprehensible

uh huh. yo. alright yo
Verse  
Im possessed by evil demons that torture me while Im sleepin
I keep dreamin of death and Im hearin people screamin.
The devils spirits trapped inside me and i want it outIm on a couch bleeding to death in a haunted house with both of my wrists slit
Im lifted up in the air and suspended in animation like somebodys holding me there.
I feel somebodies cold hands wrapping around my neck 
while i choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death. 
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes. 
Trippin over O.D bodies of dead lushesbloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushies.
Doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves 
the curtains catch fire the house melts.
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sistersthe wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters.
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adams appletwo cups of Holy water and Im lookin at em half full.
But as soon as I go to touch em they into red rumit got silent then all of these voices said...
Voices
Come! Follow me into the pits of Hell!
Eminem
I heard them yell
Voices 
Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!
End Verse
I rang the bell for service and I was greeted by his mothercovered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel.
I said I need a room so I can try to get some rest. 
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag a cess
and told me thats just for starters
Satan will be in to see me later 
to see if Im interested in being partners.

And Dr. Dre said Slim Shady you a basehead!
Uh-uhhh! So whys your face red? Man you wasted!
Well since age twelve Ive felt like a caged elf
who stayed to himself in one space chasin his tail blalblalblabla
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lees lips off
Kissed em and said I aint know silicone was sposed to be this soft
Im bout to pass out and crash and fall in the grass
faster than a fat man who sat down too fast
Cmere lady! Shady wait a minute thats my girl dog!
I dont give a damn Dre sent me to tick the world off!

Served the bartender then walked out with a tip cup
Extraterrestrial runnin over pedestrians

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to

I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk hachhh-too

I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
Hachhh-too
I spit when I talk Ill fuck anything that walks
Cmere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me mom?
Wah

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
Im steamin mad
And by the way when you see my dad?

Hi my name is my name is
What? Who?

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together.
Its like wishing for rain as I stand in the desertBut Im holding you closer than mostcause you are my heaven.
Kanye West
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann
Im wonderin why she ret to go like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna man
Now you in the field runnin plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
Ill trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer man
You dont remember when you was my sweetest
You dont remember when I called you Reeses Pieces
Cause its no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around and giggle said You so nuts! 
But nowadays we actin way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get the new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin by me I had to give you two thumbs up
And thats why
A drop in the ocean a change in the weatherI was praying that you and me might end up together.
Its like a drop in the ocean a change in the weatherI was praying that you and me might end up together.
Eminem
So young so full of life and vibrantSide by side wherever you was ridin I wentSo close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shitWhen Ronnie died you was right by my sideWith a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyesAnd a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside itYou even had the same type of childhood I didSometimes I just wanna know whyIs it that you surcame to yoursAnd mine I survived itYou ran the streets I nine to fived itWe grew up grew apart as time went by usThen I blew up to both yours and mine surprisesNow I feel the vibe I just cant describe itMuch as your pride tries to hide itYoure cold your touch its like iceAnd your eyes is the look of resentmentI can sense it and I dont like it
A drop in the ocean a change in the weatherI was praying that you and me might end up together.
Its like a drop in the ocean a change in the weatherI was praying that you and me might end up together.
Wiz Khalifa
Uh stuck alone in this wave race
Say Im living too fast dont plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas its never a need for brakes
Smoke ez-riders with hash fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars waiter bringing me plates
Shrimp and fillet Mignon we celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads my niggas who got love for me
Its lonely at the top Im tired of having company
Uh so while you busy trying to fit in Im a stand out
And view my life through this lens to see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck them niggas who hatedIm money affiliated
Pop another bottle that chronic smokin degraded
Speculating me landing must of got me mistakenIm speaking as the captain of the planesYous a runner on the jet way
A drop in the ocean a change in the weatherI was praying that you and me might end up together.
Its like a drop in the ocean a change in the weatherI was praying that you and me might end up together.

Oh Amy rehab never looked so good
I can wait Im going back ha ha woo!
Dr. Dre  yeah
we made youRelapse.
Obie yo Im sick
Damn you straight dog?
Thats why I aint got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
Thats how dudes be getting sick
Thats how dicks be getting drips
Falling victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
Thats why I aint got no time
Yo I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of the skunk one and last nights tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis Denise from the cleaners
Fucked me good you shouldve seen us
Big booty bitch switch unbearable
French role styling body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure while my shit gettin bigger
Debating on to fuck her do I wanna be a nigga
Caressing this bitch plus Im checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit I aint use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind its mandatory
Like taking hos money but thats another story
For surely your pussy on toast after we toast
Our clothes fell like bishop and juice
The womb beater clean pussy eater inserting my john
In that spot hotter than the hottest block dont stop
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking kinky finger licking
The cannon seen us at my temple when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips the ones between the hips
Pubic hairs looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of his black folks
Being a vinyl stretched the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut then I woke up next
Like what the fuck is going on here?
This bitch evaporated pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now Im frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I aint really got that shit fuck
Thats why I aint got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
Thats how dudes be getting sick
Thats how dicks be getting drips
Falling victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
Thats why I aint got no time
Now I dont wanna hit no women when this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And shes pregnant but shes egging me on begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch my only weapon is force
And I dont wanna resort to violence of any sort
But whys she shoving me for doesnt she love me no more?
Wasnt she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man Im this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
Shes having another baby in a month and its yours
And you found it isnt cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan now the plot has thickened n worse
Cause you feel like youve been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
So youre paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit youve been holding your dick
So you go to the clinic sweating every minute youre in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the menace
And its obvious to everyone in the lobby its AIDS
He aint even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home cause you gone get that ho
When you see her youre gonna bend her fucking neck back yo
Cause you love her you never wouldve expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop how could she stoop that low?
Jesus I dont believe this bitch works at the cleaners
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obies penis
Shes so deceiving shit this hos a genius she geed us
Thats why I aint got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
Thats how dudes be getting sick
Thats how dicks be getting drips
Falling victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
Thats why I aint got no time
Im busy yeah fuck these bitches
Fuck em all get money
Ha shady records
Wow Obie Trice

Step by step heart to heart
Left right left we all fall down
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I am never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it
Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino it dont matter
Id never drag them in battles that I can handle unless
I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
If some shit ever just pop off Im supposed to be beside em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie`s name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy this shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and nas shit
And even though the battle was won I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
This aint what Im in hip-hop for its not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasnt my intentions my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin
Now its just out of respect for not runnin my mouth
And talkin about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
While hes all over TV yeah Im talkin a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business
And this shit just isnt none of my business
But still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute cause
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
But now its elevated cuz once you put someones kids in it
The shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it?
Its a different ball game callin names and you aint just rappin
We actually tried to stop the  and Ja beef from happenin
Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it  smash em mash em and let him have it
Mean while my attention is pullin in another direction
Some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now hes fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin
Well fuck it that motherfucker can get it too fuck him then
But Im so busy being pissed off I dont stop to think
That we just inherited s beef with murder inc
And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
We still have soldiers thats on the front line
Thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
Well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love em back and let em know how important it is
To have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I aint try na have none of my people hurt and murdered
It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
Ill walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
Im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
Off at your jaws well then I can cuz frankly Im sick of talkin
Im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
like toy soldiersEncore.

Scalpel here sponge here
Wait hes convulsing hes convulsing!
Ah! Were gonna have to shock him! Oh my! Oh my God!
Were gonna have to shock him! Oh my God!
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts Nurse were losin him check the pulse!
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin white boy scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
And I might snap one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high this kid said
Its you and I three oclock sharp this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?
He said Dont try to run from me youll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty and I started to shake at first
Something told me Try to fake a stomach ache it works
I screamed Oww!  My appendix feels like they could burstâ€
Teacher teacher quick I need a naked nurse
Whats the matter? I dont know my leg it hurts
Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy?
Oh I mean it is but I also got a bum knee
Mr. Mathers the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt youre gonna get some extra homework
But dont you wanna give me after school detention?
Nah that bully wants to beat your ass and Ima let him
Brain damage ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
Brain damage ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
Brain damage way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes
So everyday hed shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him We shouldnt beef
But he just wouldnt leave
He kept chokin me and I couldnt breathe
He looked at me and said You gonna die honkey!â€
The principal walked in and started helpin him stomp me
  Whats going on in here?
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitors storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juiceOr stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
Im gettin you back bully!  Now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
I couldnt even see what I was tryin to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin What are you on drugs?
Look at you youre gettin blood all over my rug!
  Sorry!
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed Look bitch what have you done
Oh my God Im sorry son shut up you cunt!  I said Fuck it!
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
Brain damage ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
Brain damage ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
Brain damage its brain damage
I got brain damage its brain damage
Its probably brain damage its brain damage
Brain damage I got brain damage
brain damageThe Slim Shady LPIm going through changes
Im going through changes
Lately I really feel like Im rolling for like Philly
I feel like Im losing control of myself I sincerely
I apologize if all that I sound like is Im complaining
But life keeps on complicating and Im debating
On leaving this world this evening even my girls
Can see Im grievin I try and hide it
But I cant why do I act like Im all high and mighty
When inside Im dying I am finally realizing I need help
I cant do it by myself
Too weak  weeks Ive been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys dilly dallying
Around with the idea of ending the shit right here
Im hatin my reflection I walk around the house tryin to fight mirrors
I cant stand what I look like yeah I look fat but what do I care?
I give a fuck only thing I fear is Hailie
Im afraid if I close my eyes I might see her shit
Im going through changes
Im going through changes
I lock myself in the bedroom bathroom nappin at noon
Yeah dads in a bad mood hes always snappin at you
Marshall what happened at you? Cant stop with these pills
And youve fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughin at you
It become a problem youre too pussy to tackle get up
Be a man stand a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out homie just swift out and bust
Nah it aint like Doody to do that
He wouldnt fuckin shoot at nobody he fights first
But dwellin on it only makes the night worse
Now Im poppin Vics perks and Methadone pills
Yeah em tight verse you killed it
Fuckin drug dealers hang around me like yes man
And they gon do whatever I says when I says it
Its in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin best friend so fuck it I guess then
Im going through changes
Im going through changes
  Dont know what Im going through
But I just keep on going through changes
My friends just cant understand this new me
Thats understandable man but just think how bananas
Youd be youd be an animal too if you were trapped
In this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybodys lookin at you what you want me to do?
Im startin to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame startin to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater watchin the same damn DVD
Of the first tour the last tour he was still alive
And it hurt sore fast forward sleepin pillsll make me feel alright
And if Im still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more yeah youre motherfuckin right
I aint slowin down for no one I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma yeah homie come on dont look now
Daddy dont you die on me daddy better hold your ground
Fuck dont I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down
Im going through changes
Im going through changes
  Dont know what Im going through
But I just keep on going through changes
Wake up in the hospital
Full of tubes plus somehow Im pullin through
Swear when I come back Ima be bulletproof
Ima do it just for Proof I think I should state a few
Facts cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
Id never get to make it right so heres what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother thatll never change
Think about her every day we just could never get it together
Hey wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything Id do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain when it rains
Guess it pours yes it does wish there wasnt any pain
But I cant pretend there aint I aint placin any blame
I aint pointin fingers heaven knows there never been a saint
I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture almost hate to say
I miss you self consciously wish it didnt end this way
But I just had to get away dont know why
I dont know what else to say I guess Im
Im going through changes
Im going through changes
  Dont know what Im going through
But I just keep on going through changes
going through changesRecovery.

But I swear you try to diss me I slaughter you
Ill put that on everything like everyone does with autotune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Blows when it snows and its twenty below
Ask me why and man I just dont know

I dunno why Im so Im so cold mean things I dont need to say
I guess this is how you made me
cold wind blowsRecovery.

 mile runnin Mile SoundtrackYeah yeah follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold its all so cold all so cold oh
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that theyre real I know that most arent
Boy you think youre clever dont ya? Girl you think youre so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
Fe fi fo fum I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park its dark its winter in December
I see my target with my car and park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider
Hi there girl you mighta heard of me before
See whore youre the kinda girl that Ida
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while that shits inside ya
Im the kinda guy thats mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian yeah and now lets see her have triplets and Ill
Incinerate them babies soon as theyre out her with formaldehyde
Hide in cyanide girl you can try and hide you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin Id rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp ahh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out ooh
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that theyre real I know that most arent
Boy you think youre clever dont ya? Girl you think youre so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
So dark and so cold my friends dont know this other side of me
Theres a monster inside of me its quite ugly and it frightens me
But they cant see what I can see theres a vacancy in my tummy
Its makin me play hide and seek like Jason Im so hungry
Shes naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Close the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatantly but silently cause I know that shes sound asleep
Whos wakin me so violently and whys he on top of me?
Hes rapin me she tries to scream
Somebody please get him off me
Hes tapin me hes bitin me hes laughin like its funny
Shes scrapin me shes fightin me
Shes scratchin like some dumb freak
Escapin me no die she see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee what a sight to see Im dancin in my red panties
Im crazy but its alright with me man life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause Im dancin to quite a different drum beat
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that theyre real I know that most arent
Boy you think youre clever dont ya? Girl you think youre so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
Better try to stay wide awake
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep bitches soul Ima try to take
Pray for light today right away why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much
Might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools how about now while you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement now?
Ya mustve just heard the sound
Of my stomach growlin from down there
Holler theres no one fowler
Bound to the tub they found ya face down in the tub
I drowned you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers such prowess look how you cowered
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jaba the hut be de ba ba be de ba ba its time to die die
Ought to not even bother to scream it dont even matter
Amazin when grazin skin with these razorblades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien bathe me in holy water
Nothin like Son of Sam so please understand theres no gun in hand
Wheres the thrill in the hunt?
Theres no fun in that here I come with ax
Fun to act like lumberjack when Im hackin em up with that
What was that? Dial  someones comin in from the back
Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that theyre real I know that most arent
Boy you think youre clever dont ya? Girl you think youre so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
stay wide awakeRelapse.
Hello allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady its so nice to meet you
Its been a long time Im sorry Ive been away so long
My name is Shady I never meant to leave you
You see that chick in the gym checkin me out?
Any second Im bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and Im recklessly wreckin the house
That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?
Theres the necklace I lost right next to Stephanies blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope guess Ill reroute maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh jackpot yeah open Sesame mouth
Down the hatch had the feelin you cant match it
A rat-tat-tap on your door with the damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tackin a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like  some Xanaxs
Shortly come back Im tryin to score me some lap dances
Im bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula D and s with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch Im back atcha
Well I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do was to just say hello
And are you menstruatin baby? My lil friends waitin to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin and your bootys shakin like jello
Well I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do was to just say hello
Yeah my equilibriums off must be the lithium
I dont need to buy any drugs man people gimme em
It just becomes everyday extra curriculum
No reason in particular it was strictly fun
A th of rum and  bottles of 
 people asleep in my damn livin room
Excuse me hun but what is your name Vivienne?
I woke up next to ya naked and err did we um?
Of course we did but didnt I strap a jimmy hun?
Im lookin for the torn wrapper but there dont seem to be one
No offense baby girl I dont mean any harm
But disease is somethin Im tryna keep my penis free from
I find the package and Im cool I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of s Im fiendin for some
My head is poundin to the beat of the drum
Well I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
Do ya happen to have anythin on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Well I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
Oh those were the days they certainly were
Its hurtin me to know that Ill be closin that curtain for good
Word word word word word word word
I second that and a third rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
Hes no longer gettin them free  bucks for these Percodans
Plus its gettin to be where he lustfully searched the den
Pain is hittin his knee and his muscles be hurtin him
Tirelessly on the phone tryin to russle up
Muscle relaxants for his back and a couple of Paxs
Now hes doublin backwards and hes stumblin back
Slipped and fell hit his back bone heard somethin go crack
Now hes up in the bathroom like hes bustin a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
Im just bustin my own chops while Im bustin a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it Im back
Well I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
Do ya happen to have anythin on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
Thats all Im sayin
Hello allow me to introduce myself

Curtain Call
When Im Gone
Introduction
Yeah...
Its my life...
My own words I guess...
Verse 
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for?
Not the expression no literally give an arm for?
When they know theyre your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
Daddy look what I made Dads gotta go catch a plane
Daddy wheres Mommy? I cant find Mommy where is she?
I dont know go play Hailie baby your Daddys busy
Daddys writing this song this song aint gonna write itself
Ill give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother whos a spitting image of her
Thats Slim Shady yeah baby Slim Shadys crazy
Shady made me but tonight Shadys rocka-by-baby...
Chorus
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing So baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing So baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back...
Verse 
I keep having this dream Im pushin Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming she dont want me to sing
Youre making Mommy cry why? Why is Mommy crying?
Baby Daddy aint leaving no more Daddy youre lying
You always say that you always say this is the last time
But you aint leaving no more Daddy youre mine
Shes piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please Daddy dont leave Daddy - no stop it!
Goes in her pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket
Its got a picture thisll keep you safe Daddy take it withcha
I look up its just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin walls must be talking cuz man I can hear em
Theyre saying Youve got one more chance to do right - and its tonight
Now go out there and show that you love em before its too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
Its turns to a stage theyre gone and this spotlight is on
And Im singing...
Chorus
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing So baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing So baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back...
Verse 
Sixty thousand people all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes theyre throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
Theyre screaming so loud I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down I dont believe what Im seeing
Daddy its me help Mommy her wrists are bleedingBut baby were in Sweden how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you Daddy you told me that you werent leavin
You lied to me Dad and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin it says Number One Dad
Thats all I wanted I just want to give you this coin
I get the point - fine me and Mommy are gone
But baby wait its too late Dad you made the choice
Now go up there and show em that you love em more than us
Thats what they want they want you Marshall they keep.. screamin your name
Its no wonder you cant go to sleep just take another pill
Yeah I bet you you will. You rap about it yeah word k-keep it real
I hear applause all this time I couldnt see
How could it be that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around find a gun on the ground cock it
Put it to my brain and scream die Shady and pop it
The sky darkens my life flashes the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
Thats when I wake up alarm clocks ringin theres birds singin
Its Spring and Hailies outside swinging I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..
ChorusOutro
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn

Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? Yeah yeah!
Try cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? Huh?
My brains dead weight Im tryin to get my head straight
but I cant figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate Ummmm..
And Dr. Dre said Slim Shady you a basehead!
Uh-uhhh! So whys your face red? Man you wasted!
Well since age twelve Ive felt like Im someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lees tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Cmere slut! Shady wait a minute thats my girl dog!
I dont give a fuck God sent me to piss the world off!
Chorus
Eminem
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper Owwwwwwww!
Walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup Wsssshhhhh...
Extraterrestrial killin pedestrians
Rapin lesbians while they screamin LETS JUST BE FRIENDS!
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her Id grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her Oh thank you!
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans Aaahhhhhh!
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph Dude can I get your autograph?
So I signed it Dear Dave thanks for the support ASSHOLE!
Chorus
Eminem
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! Get him!
Dr. Dre dont just stand there OPERATE!
Im not ready to leave its too scary to die
Ill have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk hachhh-too
I spit when I talk Ill fuck anything that walks Cmere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? WAH! YOU AINT GOT NO TITS! WAH!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head BANG!
Im steamin mad Arrrggghhh! 
And by the way when you see my dad? Yeah?
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Verse 
Ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills
Im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants
With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue turn your system up
Twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smoke
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hits a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion there aint no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...

Verse 
Bust it I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
I got to meet the fence fruit was stompin at your feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
My coil hands around this microphone lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MCs are feeble I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the only one
Imitator Intimidator Stimulator Simulator of data Eliminator
Theres never been a greater since the burial of Jesus

My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So Im assuming all responsibility

Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical
Id rather led a tactful tractical track for your fancy
In fact I cant see or cant imagine
A man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam

To do it again then if he does it again
Youll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the tenth
Bitch Ima kill you I aint done this aint the chorus

Lyrical Rosco give back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tic-tock song
Time to show you the most kick ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick ax is a sick asshole
Tic tac toe frozen six pack with exacto
Knives stranglin wives with big lasso
Few bags of the grass zig zags Im with the Doc so
You know how that go skull and the crossbones
This is poison the boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home my lil vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six pack sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
Its not what you expected nor what you thought so
About time that you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke
It must be the ganja its the marijuana
Thats creepin up on me while Im so high
Maybe its the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatevers gotten into me I dont mind
It must be the ganja its the marijuana
Thats creepin up on me while Im so high
Maybe its the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatevers got into me I dont mind
Your dreams are getting fulfilled ooh Im literally getting the chills
Spittin at will me and Dre have just finished splittin a pill
Youre submittin to skill sittin still
Im admittin Im beginnin to feel like I dont think anyones real
Faced with a dilemma I can be Dalai Llama
And become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please dont upset me mama you lookin sexy mama
Dont know if its the lala or the rum and Pepsi mama
Dont want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra toppin the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row?
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate
And which model which lake they found her in
And how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one
Which knife and which gun what kid what wife and which nun?
Dont stop I like this its fun the fuckin nights just begun
It must be the ganja its the marijuana
Thats creepin up on me while Im so high
Maybe its the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatevers gotten into me I dont mind
It must be the ganja its the marijuana
Thats creepin up on me while Im so high
Maybe its the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatevers got into me I dont mind
When Im behind a mic dynamite is what its kinda like
Youre stuck with the same stick that youre tryin to light
Behind the boards is Dre legends are made this way
Isnt it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
He can give her some she can give them some
Get behind a Lynn drum make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
Youre spinnin drama when it comes to lyrics and pennin some
Startin from scratch and then endin up at the end enough
Capable of bringin a Pulitzer strong believe a bullets a
Titanium cranium thats full of surprises
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evenin this aint even a weed thing
I aint even smoke anything I aint even drink anything

Im waitin for hell like hell shit Im anxious as hell
Manson youre safe in that cell thankful is jail
I used to be my mommys little Angel at twelve
At thirteen I was putting shells in the gage on the shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
Till I cut a kittens head off
And stuck it in this kids mailbox
Hey! mom! mom!
I used to give a fuck now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of sucess? It sucks too much press
And stress too much zest and breasts too upset
Its just too much mess I guess
I must just blew up quick yes
Grew up quick? No
Was raised right?
Whatever you say is wrong
Whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say Hi
Became a commodity because Im W H I T E
Cause MTV was so friendly to me
Cant wait till Kim sees me
Now is it worth it?  Look at my life how is it perfect?

I take each individual degenerate his head and reach into it
Just to see if hes influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit hes an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
My name is Slim Shady
Ive been crazy way before radio didnt play me
The sensational
Back its the incredible
With Ken Kaniff who just finds the men edible
Its Ken Kaniff on the internet
Tryin to lure your kids with him into bed
Its a sick world were livin in these days
Slim for petes sake put down Christopher Reeves legs
Geez! you guys are so sensitive
Slim its a touchy subject try and just dont mention it
Mind with no sense in it fried gets so frantic
Cause eyes get so squinted Im blind from smoke in em
With my windows tinted with nine limos rented
Doin lines of coke in em with a bunch of guys hoppin out
All high and dosin it
And thats where I get my name from

And thats a whole school of bullies shot up all of the time
Cause Im Shady they call me as crazy as this world was
Over this whole YK thing and by the way
NSync why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what yall think?
Lip-sync and buy a bigger size of ear rings?
Thats why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screamin is making my ears ring
So I just throw up the middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
Itd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this
Sorry Puff but I dont give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
Id still fuck her with no rubber and come inside her
And have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it aint mine

Im blew out from this blunt
Fuck
i m backThe Marshall Mathers LP.
Yeah woo shit
Aight
Guess what? I aint coming in yet
Ill come in a minute
Aye yo this is my love song
It goes like this
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin youre gonna probably crawl
And youll be sick then and youll probably barf
And my prediction is youre gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And every things spinning youre beginnin to think
Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guiness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin you
Get in your car start it and start drivin
Over the island and cause a  car pile-up
Earth calling pilot to co-pilot
Look at the life on this planet sir no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin
And Im so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place Im outta place
Im in outer space Ive just vanished without a trace
Im going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
Ill be back in an hour or so
Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
Cause every time I try to tell them No
They wont let me ever let them go
Im a sucka all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
 years later Im as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
Ive got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name so I dont need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want wherever I want however I want
However I do show some respect to few
As ecstasy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you
We just met but I think Im in love with you
But youre on it too so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like Yo what the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch you know I have got stuff to do
Cause if I get caught cheatin then Im stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna
Catch up sooner or later but fuck it Im on one so lets enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord so its not a straight line no more
Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shits sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit six hits wont even get me high no more
So bye for now Im gonna try to find some more
Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
Cause every time I try to tell them No
They wont let me ever let them go
Im a sucka all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
Thats the sound of a bottle when its hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow youre probably gonna wanna do it again
Whats a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? And whats a little fight?
Tomorrow youll be boys again
Its your life live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere where was you brought up?
It dont matter as long as you get where youre going
Cause none of the shit is gonna mean shit where were going
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
But youre young youve got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw parties to crash sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldnt
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldnt
But Im all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
To better drugs and updated
But Ive still got a lot of growing up to do
Ive still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when its all said and done Ill be 
Before I know it with a  on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Haley while Haleys out getting smashed
Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
Cause every time I try to tell them No
They wont let me ever let them go
Im a sucka all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve
I dont wanna but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
Cause every time I try to tell them No
They wont let me ever let them go
Im a sucka all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
Drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me
These drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me

Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggaz from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central

You and what army could harm me?
D R E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach

Youre found dead in your garage with ten oclock news coverage
Gotta love it cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside come bounce with us
Standin over you with a twelve gauge about to bust
Its like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough Im in the club shootin with Puff
Bitch please you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees come on
And you dont really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
Thats the devil they always wanna dance
And you dont really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me

Aww naw big Slim Dogg

Back up in the heezy Baby
Hes Sha-day!
Hes so crazy!
Hahaha! Gimme the mic let me recite til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if hes right? Im just a criminal makin a living
Off of the worlds misery what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin the bird
Livin the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin at night of screamin at Mom schemin to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down theres a decent human being in me
It just cant be found so the reason youve been seeing this me
Is cause this is me now the recent dude whos being this mean
So when you see me dressin up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin the fag word so freely
Its just me being me here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin dick you fagot
You happy now? Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
That I go
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
Cause they know

Cause you dont know me I dont know you
So dont approach me I wont approach you
And dont insult me I wont insult you
Cause you dont know what I will or I wont do
Make no mistake Im the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate straight out the gate
Carried my weight but seem to receive nothin but hate
Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped locked in a trunk get shot in the face
No hoes no clothes no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and cant stand me
Yeah
Packed up moved out started a new family
So all this strugglin for what so I can blow up
Marry a slut but cant watch my seed grow up?
Fuck that this the fuckin thanks I get
For tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down
Upside down
Cause you seein more support than Im seein my child
Its like everyday I wake up another drama
Its a wonder Im alive survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel  Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they wont let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether its unloaded full or an unregistered one
No bullet youre so full of shit
This clip is so full itll spit if I dont pull it
And dont give me no bullshit Im not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Dont tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is bitch
Cause you dont know me I dont know you
So dont approach me I wont approach you
And dont insult me I wont insult you
Cause you dont know what I will or I wont do
Cause you dont know me I dont know you
So dont approach me I wont approach you
And dont insult me I wont insult you
Cause you dont know what I will or I wont do
This aint business this is personal bitch
You dont know Xzibit from shit new school class dismissed
I had a very fucked up day Im needin this fit
Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the th
Yo Em its time to get serious with it
Yeah
Time for everybody to feel it similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs Xzibit brain on thugs
Aint no neighborhood thats big enough to bang on us
Aint no love lost my niggaz relax yourself
Im about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel you played like a fuckin piano
Ridin slow through Cali like Im ridin a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like Tony Soprano who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke thats the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga thats droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat put your head in a vise-grip
And turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat run and tell cops?
Fuck that I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber gun in the waist
and one in the ankle waitin for someone to come to my place
Tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And its a disgrace Hailey cant play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
Screamin some shit leanin out your windows beepin n shit
Or pullin up in my drive like I wont leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then I do an interview with Spin tellin them
That if someone comes to my crib
Ima shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters blow it out of proportion
Oh now hes pullin guns on his fans
Just for tryin to stand on his porch
And Im the bad guy cause
I dont answer my door like Hey hi!
You guys wants some autographs?
Okay form a straight line
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
And climbin the roof at night
And hidin outside to snipe you
Its not that I dont like you
Its just that Im not behind the mic
Im a person whos just like you
don t approach meMiscellaneous feat. Dr Dre  Cent Jay-Z Cashis Stat Quo
Its not about lyrics anymore its about a hot beat and a catchy hook
Eminem
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids jeez
Dont give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitz
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJs playing them hits
Oh this my jam this my shit
We dont know a word to a verseAll we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous the whole formulas switched
Cause we dont know anymore what are hits
Is it the beat is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same  clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When  year olds control the remote
And Ashleys got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables
Jay-Z
If the emphasis on the compact disc isnt the beat
Than Im gon feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing cost Jermaine a lot of dough oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
Its just the way the game go oh it takes  to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
Im tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac  in front of Hot 
And call my publicist tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable
Dr Dre
They said s the new 
Funny must mean s the new 
Interesting cause ever since then its been innocence
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
Its all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said its his last and  and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook
Eminem
Wait Dre look
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise Ill be true to you
 Cent

You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
Its the kid that flip flows who used to flip Os
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
Im international I get my dick licked round the globe
Im sick right into show riding on lolos
Puffing on coco my bitch in Manolos
Dont fuck with the dodos I sling for dumb hoes

Just give me my check and Ill be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You aint even listening and I just took your money
Stat Quo
There once was a time everywhere he turned
Shady aftermath was all ya heard
But they say  sang too much
And Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well fuck the fuck offs
All yall eat soft be mad we bad fresh up outta the vault oh!
New syllables eat ball ya fucks offs
Your house your bitch Im getting sucked off
East south midwest even up north
Falling victim to wax spitting bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can Im running past while yall walk
Cahi
Shady made me for bringing it back
For the history of rap
Its gone with a snap a sneer and a clap
What happened to just spittin about living in the muthafucking city you at
In the grimiest condition I breath in drama
King Mathers and Cash me thats freak karma
Im everything anything you could never be
Its a hitting rhyme in the month deep
I speak with a piece no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest contract to sign
By blood Im in this squad for life
Hear out my wind pipes and I just chime
Im the reason you guys wont say that line
Im crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
Im Rosemarys baby
Eminem
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise Ill be true to you

Good evening. This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of  million and a half feet
Thats  million miles in the sky
Please undo your seat belt for take off
You are now free to smoke about the cabin
Dr. Dre
Im Dre from back in the day from
N.W.A from black and the grey from
Chokin a bitch to smacking her face from
Stackin up bodies to racking their kids up from
Racking up hits to stacking them crates up
Im still hungry and Im back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rap entertainment
Me and shady for us competition faggot there aint none
Em
Speak of the devil
Its the attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from
Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon the great one
Wait it aint funny man Its urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun
And a emergency squirtgun to spray everyone
Chorus
So one more time for old times sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And lets go youre now smoking with the best the best
I said one more time for old times sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And lets go youre now smoking with the best the best
Em
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wirelessA nice environment
Surprised entirely hypnotized by the sound
I surround the hydrants taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye here I am again
Naked wives and vicodin
Before I begin to get so high pussy boy I could spin
Vin vin Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
Ill show you every inch girls of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know its a sin to tease blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse if its forced its him
Dont fight the feeling if youre feeling the force within
When you wake in the morning next to the porcelain
Repeat Chorus
Dre
Now where theres smoke theres fire
Where theres fire theres flames
Where theres flames theres chronic
Either you high or you aint
I got no time for no games
Em
Nah-ah he aint playingHes gonna get the AK and aim it at your brain
Im slightly insane Vodka and creatine
Hypnotic and red bull its an incredible energy drink
And its giving me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl you wont catch me CSI
Its as easy as pie and as simple as cake
Dre. get on the mic and make them tremble and shake
Dre
Now put your smoke up in the air
Raise your Henny and coke
And if you really want to get fucked up just let me know
We can smoke if there is no more lighter fluid to do it
Lets get into it you smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You muthafuckers aint smoking you just holding shit up
Now here we go lets get up get down hold up a blunt
I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one
Cause if at first you dont succeed
Wont hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off puffing them trees
Em
Was luck enough for me
Fuck yeah light it up cheech
Come on smoke me up cuzGet me contact buzz
Get me on track they love me when Im on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady man come on back what
Man were losing him he wont even respond back fuck

b rabit st battleMiscellaneousYou know I just dont get it last year I was nobody
This year Im sellin records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin
The fuck you want from me? Ten million dollars
Get the fuck out of here
You see Im just Marshall Mathers Im just a regular guy
I dont know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me
Yo you might see me joggin you might see me walkin
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch wont quit barkin
Or leanin out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Lookin for Bigs killers dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I dont see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off em
And get dollars that shoulda been theres like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist poppin and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin shit like some twenty six year old skinny Cartman
Im anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill NSync dont get me started
These fuckin brats cant sing and Britneys garbage
Whats this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New kids on the block sucked a lot of dick
Boy-girl groups make me sick
And I cant wait til I catch all you fagots in public
Ima love it
Vanilla Ice dont like me said some shit in vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin I dont care just bite me
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little  year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in fagots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns cause they look queer
Fagot to dope and silent gay
Claimin Detroit when yall live twenty miles away
And I dont wrestle Ill knock you fuckin fagots the fuck out
Ask em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck blaow!
Look at yall runnin your mouth again
When you aint seen a fuckin mile road South of 
And I dont need help from D- to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim anus you damn right slim anus
I dont get fucked in mine like you two little flaming fagots
Coz Im just Marshall Mathers
Im not a wrestler guy Ill knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me
Is it because you love me that yall expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch get off me go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop thats on top
It is fucked up head that Ive got Ive gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks hes too big to do some shit with MC get bizzy
My fuckin bitch moms suin for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill Ive been stealin
Shit where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesnt matter your fagot!
Talkin about I fabricated my past
Hes just aggravated I wont ejaculate in his ass
So tell me what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden I got  some cousins
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybodys so happy and proud
Im finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriends house
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page flipped right fast
And what do I see?  A picture of my big white ass
Okay let me give you motherfuckers some help
Here double XL double XL
Now your magazine shouldnt have so much trouble to sell
Fuck it Ill even buy a couple myself
Coz Im just Marshall Mathers Im just a regular guy
I dont know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me
Coz Im just Marshall Mathers Im just a regular guy
I dont know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me

Theres no escaping
Theres no place to hide
You scream Someone save me
But they dont pay no mind goodbye
Youre walkin down a horror corridor
Its almost  in the mornin and your in a
Nightmare its horrible
Right theres the coroner
Waitin for you to turn the corner
So he can corner ya youre a goner
Hes on to ya out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run all you want is to rest
Cause you cant run anymore youre done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it
Here I sit while Im caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing the Calotapin
While Im nodding in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn holding onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it wake up naked
At McDonalds with blood all over me
Dead bodies behind the counter shit
Guess I mustve just blacked out again not again
Its  A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
But I guess I mustve killed em
Killed em
Sitting nude in my living room
Its almost noon I wonder whats on the tube
Maybe theyll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall paneling
Dismantling every candle on top
Of the fire place mantle and grab my flannel
And my bandanna then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standing in my front window
If you look in Im just a hooligan whos used to
Using hallucinogens causing illusions again
Brain contusions again vutting and bruising the skin
Razors scissors and pins Jesus when does it end?
Phases that I go through dazed and Im so confused
Days that I dont know who gave these molecules to me
What am I gonna do? Hey the prodigal son
The godfather for one
Very methodical when I slaughter them
Its  A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
But I guess I mustve killed em
Killed em
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
I cut and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I cant quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of a Jack
My last vic and a half a flashlight up
Kim Kardashians ass I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member December
I think it was I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinking tub
Cut him up into pieces and just
When I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bathwater that oughta be fun
Thats when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just dont seem to bother me none
Its  A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here man
Theres got to be one oh no theres probably none
He can scream all that he wants top of his lungs
But aint no stopping me from chopping him up
Up
Its  A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
But I guess I mustve killed em
Killed em

Yeah oh get up I said get up lets go

So give us room to do our thing
Cuz we aint come to hurt no one
So everybody come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone
Now first of all Im the boss I just wanna get that across
Man even my Dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes its a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows
Spray  painted doors with the flames on em
Michigan plates and my names on em
Baby Shadys here come on get him if you dames want em
But he aint stupid so quit tryin to run them games on him
Hes immune to Cupid why you tryin to put your claims on him?
Cuz you wont do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
Theres a half a gallon in it that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin home now could I get that lap dance?
Shes got a tattoo of me right up off her ass man
In the streets of Warren Michigan we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy whos the man
Now get up dance
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Aint nothin but a White Trash Party
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there aint no one but us trash
You dunno you better ask somebody
Cuz were havin a White Trash Party
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin like a zombie from Night of the Livin Dead
And tomorrow Ill prolly still be too high to get outta bed
Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp parta the hammer
Mixin Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot to kill like Im hollerin Die Santa
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin ta play the wall like you pawlin
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darlin
Cuz as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin
Makin it rain for them ladies in the minis
But Im not throwin ones fives tens or even twenties
Im throwin quarters nickels dimes pennies up at skinnies
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Dennys
From the north east and west but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it cuz homie that hoods tighter then Kennys
So ladies if your belly buttons not an innie then Im outie
Now hop in my minivan lets get rowdy cmon
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Aint nothin but a White Trash Party
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there aint no one but us trash
You dunno you better ask somebody
Cuz were havin a White Trash Party
Now whether youre black white or purple if youre misunderstood
But you dont give a fuck you werent doin shit that you should
Long as you know youre up to evil
And youre no damn good get on the floor man and rep your hood
Now honey dont let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin lot
Cuz girl I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater Ill be damned if I feed a chick
It aint like me to split a piece a dry pita
Ill be the S L to the I M to the S H A D Y
And I dont need a tank top to be a wife beater
Ill rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
Fore I turn over a new leaf clown Ill tell ya now
Im so raw I still need to unthaw you feel me yall?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby a body like thats against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Aint nothin but a White Trash Party
So lets have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there aint no one but us trash
You dunno you better ask somebody
Cuz were havin a White Trash Party

Chorus ~Jazmine Sullivan~
Got to have it
yeah I made it
I’m addicted
...
Verse  ~Eminem~
This was a beat with no words at first it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind it’s brain strength training
Starts off something like shady’s an insane maniac
Yeah slim shady thats a zany name aint it
Now all you needs an image to go with the name baby
Wife beaters and white t-shirts
Hanes mainly its a long shot but is it possible
Theres a lane maybeIf not he’s gonna have to come and change the whole game mainly
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it
He can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name feinting
Shady did it he sold out the whole stadium
Joe smo made it he took his plain jane lady
And his baby Hailey out the trailer
But he aint trailing anymore he’s ahead of the race
While maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he’s about to be raped by this game
Repeat Chorus
Verse  ~Eminem~
You’re operating on all cylinders
Syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts
People are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grillin’ ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya die for ya
But you can’t decipher why for the life of ya
It wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again
She found vicodin in your pants last night again
Your disputes public
Nothings private anymore
When your best friends say bye bye to him
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim
But this is what you wanted Marshall aint it
Fuck no the way that it turned out
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it
the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relation-ship
With another girl this World is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world
Proceed take another hit
Sniff til I fucking url
Tell em all to fucking sit and spin til they fucking twirl
middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game oh well fuck it then
Repeat Chorus
cocaineOutta ControlA lotta people ask me

Nowhere to run to run to now

Dig me up broken tibias fibias yeah fix me up
 sluts all of them dyin from asphyxia
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups toxins boxes of oxy pads
Enough oxy cotton to send a fuckin ox to rehab
Whack job in a bag and a black stalkin cap
Jackin off to a hockey mask at a boxin match
He cant say that yes he can
I just did faggot now guess again
You better text message to your next of kin
Tell em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Throw a fuckin lesbian in wetzy men
So faggidy faggidy faggidy raggidy Ann and Andy
No raggidy Andy and Andy no it cant be it cant be
Yes it can be the fuckin Antichrist is back
Danny and Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville calamity
Goddamn it insanity pills fanny pack filled with zanies
Through every nook and cranny lookin for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk negligee lookie
Razor blades with me to make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline make up layin on the table with weed
Slim Shady shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out of the fuckin toilet when youre takin a pee
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
Six semen samples  strands of hair
Found at the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe and canopy beds
And glad bags yeah glad to be back
Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fuckin doctor I aint understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton I aint enlightened
Bitin into a fuckin Vicadin like Im a Viking
Oh lighten the strikin might be a fuckin sign I need a psychic
Evaluation fuck Jason its Friday the th
That means is just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin lesbian shouldnt have had her legs in the way
Now shes pregnant and gay missin both legs and beggin to stay

Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
So tell the critics Im back and Im comin to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable cannibal shootin animal
Light up a cannon and have him catapult addin a dog
Captain of the cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers lookin like a liar swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Voorhees with a 
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fuckin nectarine
And sat him in a fuckin fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin wiffle bat Drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch ooh
Lookin like I got in a fuckin pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity can it be vanity? Where is the humanity?
And havin a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Cut your fuckin head off and ask you where you headed off to
Get it headed off to? Medic this headaches awful
This anesthetics pathetic sos this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin my hard taco
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
So it wasnt a choice it was I had to do this
And now I got  days clean and thats all I have to share thanks
Thanks for sharin Brian is there anyone else
Who would like to share this evenin?
Yeah I got somethin to share
When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here baby boy just come here to me
Youre a cock boy everybody wants you
Youre gayer than you would ever claim to
I wont have to rape you
So homie lay down down down
Lay down down down lay down down down
Lay down lay down

This always went over real big in Gay A
Okay wait I got another one
I just love condoms and lots of cum
No? Oh shit
undergroundRelapse.
Sometimes I just feel like quittin
I still mic why do I put up this fight why do I still write
Sometimes its hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I just wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
But Im still white sometimes I just hate life
Something aint right hit the brake lights
Case of this stage fright draw on the plane flight
Call but I might fall
It aint my fault breaking my balls
My insides crawl and I clam up
I just slam shut I just cant do it
My whole man-hoods just been stripped
Ive just been picked so I must then get on the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo Im going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this aint my room
Im a man Im a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to leave and just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these track man Im a never look back
And Im gone and I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
Aint no followin footsteps Im making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this aint my room
Walking these train tracks trying to regain back
The spirit I have before I go back to the same crap
To the same plant in the same pants
Trying to chase rap gotta move a.s.a.p
Gotta get a new plan mommas gotta new man
Poor little baby sister she dont understand
Sits in front of the tv buries her nose in the pad
And just colours until the crayon get dull in her hand
While she just colours her big brother and mother and dad
Theres no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish that I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset cause I aint blew up yet
Its like I grew up but I aint grown up to nuts yet
Dont got a rep my step dont got enough pep
The pressures too much man Im just trying to do whats best
And I try sit alone and I cry yo I wont tell her why
Not a moment goes by that I look right at the sky
Please Im begging you god
Please dont let me be fishin holding no regular job
Yo I hope you will be getting home whereva you are
Yo Im telling you dog Im bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby Im never to far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And Im a be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own Ill make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this aint my room
Im a man Im a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to leave and just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these track man Im a never look back
And Im gone and I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
Aint no followin footsteps Im making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this aint my room
You got to live it to feel it you didnt then you wouldnt get it
Well see what the big deal is why wasnt and still is
To be walking this borderline of detroit city limits
Its different in it a certain significant of certificate
Of authenticity youd never even see but its everything to me
Its my credibilaty you never seen heard smelt a meda ta mc
Whos incredable on the same pedestal as me
The chaque still unsigned having a rough time
Sit on the porche with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve mcs in the lunch line
But when it comes crunch time where do my punch lines go
Who must I show to bust my flow where must I go who must I know
Or am I just another grabbing the bucket
Cause I aint having no luck with this little rappers so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet Im starting to doubt shit
Im feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum yo my clothes aint about shit
At the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit
And its cold trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like Im always stuck in this batteling mode
My defenses are so up one thing dont want it pity from no one
This city is no fun there is no sun and its so dark
Sometimes I just feel like Im being pulled a-part
From each one of my limbs by each one of my friends
Its enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I just feel like a robot sometimes I just know not
What Im doing I just blow my head as a stove top
I just explode the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I dont got
But I learned its time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Aint no callin her next time I need a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the word
Uh uh got the urge suddenly its a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy hits the curve
Time to show these free world leaders three and the third
I am no longer scared now Im free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the medium curve
Hit the burbs and run and see its a blur this aint my room
Im a man Im a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to leave and just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these track man Im a never look back
And Im gone and I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
Aint no followin footsteps Im making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this aint my room
 mile Mile SoundtrackI dont know why this
Yes man as the world turns
  World keeps turning round and round
We all experience things in life
  But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
Trials and tribulations
  I dont know why this
That we all must go through
  World keeps turning round and round
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
  But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
And light up like Jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby and we suing the courts
Cuz were dope as fuck and only get a  in the source yo
They never shouldve booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool takin the shit now warn bulls
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasnt me I got a twin
Oh my god its you! Not again
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cuz I murdered my guinea pig
And stuck him in the microwave
After that it was straight to the  ouncers
Slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson Ill past the test guessin
And all the other kids said Eminems a dishead
Hell never last the only class hell pass is Phys Ed
May be true till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she needed slim fast
Who me?
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tannys
And stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin
It began storming I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
  I dont know why this
As the world turns
  World keeps turning round and round
These are the days of our lives
These are the things
That we must go through
  But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
Day by day
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape
From their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a  in the source
Hypercondriac hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor standin by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and Im still tryin  to nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said What up its nice to meet ya
Id like to treat ya to a Bagel and a slice of pizza
But Im broke as fuck
And I dont get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I aint got no weed no Phillies or no papers
Plus Im a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money and dont try nothin funny
Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her but so I gotta catch her first
Ran threw alleys parkin lots and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know youre in there bitch! I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now
She said Come in its unlocked!
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn
She said Come her big boy lets get acquainted
I turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg No please let go
But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left now Im hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den go go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted Now bitch lets see who gets the best!
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Come here bitch
Come here
Take this motherfuckin dick
Bitch come here
  I dont know why this
And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
  World keeps turning round and round
  But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
We all face small obstacles
  I dont know why this
And challenges everyday
That we must go through
  World keeps turning round and round
These are the things that surround us
Through our atmosphere
  But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
Every day
  I dont know why this
Every single day the world keeps turning
Keeps turning
Keeps turning
  World keeps turning round and round

  Oh shit
What now nigga? What now what are you doin?

Brewster Projects nigga
One shot two shot three shots four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door
Somebodys lickin shots off
Securitys gone Im dropped in the club
And Im tryna run and get my muthafuckin gun
Nigga what about your wife
Nigga fuck my wife
Im tryin ta run and save my muthafuckin life
Oh shit the shooters comin
Bitches hollerin niggas runnin
People shot all over the floor
And Im tryin ta make it to the St. Andrews door
Thats the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tech
I dont see nobody but Fat Five and Hex
Kuniva you aight
These niggas is trippin
Wheres Bizarre at?
Im tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin everywhere and niggas is wildin
Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin
This chick is clingin onto me sobbin and sighin
Sayin she didnt mean to diss me earlier and she cryin
But its real and its on and cats is gettin killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she yellin
Dont leave me
I told her Id be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my . I hope its not to late
One shot two shot three shots four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door
Somebodys lickin shots off
I been tryna call you all day mothafucka where you at?
Im on seven mile what the fuck was that?
Damn somebody hit me from the back
With they car?
With a gat nigga and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole them niggas some hoes
Is you hit?
I dont know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
Shit thats the clique we beefin wit
Man and I was on my way there
  I swear
Believe me Im leavin my carcass today
Ima park my car and walk the rest of the way
Im in the mood to strut my AK aint even tucked
Ima meet you at the club we gon fuck these hoes up
One shot two shot three shots four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door
Somebodys lickin shots off
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin outside the door waitin in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D perform
The fire marshals know the venues too small
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of em off
Missed who hes aimin for six feet aways the door
Into St. Andrews hall now the strays flyin all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
Im posted up at the bar havin a maseltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God Im alive I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
No I guess not what the fuck? Oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I cant pull her
Goddamn there just went another damn bullet Im hit
My vest is barely able to handle it its too thin
If I get hit again I cant do it I scoop deep
Follow Bizarres path ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin it out
But I cant see who hes shootin it out with
But Denauns right behind him squeezin his four fifth
One shot two shot three shots four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door
Somebodys lickin shots off
Its Friday night came to this bitch right?
Big ass to my left hand Desert Eagle to my right
I aint come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
Although I cant stay here to fight cuz Im poppin niggas tonight
Thats right bitches Im drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka
So one shot for the money twos to stop the show
Thirds for the bartender theres plenty of shots to go
I just wanna know whos drivin a black Mitsubishi
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece
One shot two shot three shots four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door
Somebodys lickin shots off

Original Bad Boy on the case cover your face
Came in the place blowed and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellent better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E better check the spelling with a capital
Somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adams apple
Hurry up
Somebody dropped me on my head and I was sure
That my mother did it but the bitch wont admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said Im ready now bitch aint you feelin these kicks cunt?
The world aint ready for me yet I can tell
Ill probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
Im sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And Im hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Yuck yuck
Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If yall dont like me you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep I dont feel it
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy hello hi
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
Im ice grillin you starin you down with a gremlin grin
Im Eminem youre a fag in a womens gym
Im Slim the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head spazmatic
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat lined jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed IV full of Thai weed
Lookin Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins joined at the groin like lesbians
Uh pins and needles hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins it probably all depends
On if I keep on killin my girlfriends
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy listen
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
Last night I O.D.d on rush mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
Shucks
Im an alcoholic and thats all I can say
I call in to work cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol  and talk about how violent Ill be
Give me eleven Excederin my headll spin
Medicinell get me revvin like a  jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
Doctor check this rash look how red its been
Its probably AIDS forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That dont even make sense like dykes usin dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit thats on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme
I couldnt read it damn

Ladies and Gentlemen introducing the new
And improved you know who
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push no friend of Bush
Im the center piece youre a Maltese
Im a pitbull off his leash all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
Im back now Ive come to release this info
Ill be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can a bitch dont want no beef with Slim
No! Not even on my radar
So wont you please jump off my dick lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos

Dont be scurred cause thur aint nothin to worry bout
Let your hur down
Let your hair down to the track yeah kick on back

With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senates face in push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin
You might not like this white hot light
That Im under no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no I wont leave no stone unturned
Oh no I wont leave wont go nowhere
Do si do oh yo ho hello there
Oh yeah dont think I wont go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your motherfuckin ass gets drafted
While youre at band camp thinkin the crap cant happen
Til you fuck around get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin
Fuckin assassins hijackin Amtraks crashin
All this terror America demands action
Next thing you know youve got Uncle Sams ass askin
To join the army or what youll do for their navy
You just a baby gettin recruited at eighteen
Youre on a plane now eatin their food and their baked beans
Im twenty-eight they gon
Take you fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein you say Shady

Nothin moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin boosts me more or suits me beautifully

Hungry like a fuckin younger me

sweet home alabamaMiscellaneousWheres my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go yeah yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have Ive been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid thats behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin
Tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin
Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
Look at me now I betcha probably sick of me now
Aint you mama? I ma make you look so ridiculous now
Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
One more time
I said Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Im a expose it Ill take you back to 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I dont on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim Id grit my teeth and Id try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailies sake I maybe made some mistakes
But Im only human but Im man enough to face em today
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause Id of killed em shit I wouldve shot Kim and them both
Its my life Id like to welcome yall to the Eminem show
Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
One more time
I said Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet ha
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessin your mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin
Goin through public housin systems victim of Munchausens syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt
Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach doesnt it?
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what ya gettin older now and its cold when yaw lonely
And Nathans growin up so quick hes going to know that youre phony
And Hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
Screw this song keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be!
Im sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
One more time
I said Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet

Cause mamas got a new husband and a stepson
And you dont want a brother do ya? Nah
Maybe when youre old enough to understand a little better

But for now well just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out

THE END
im ready babyMiscellaneousYo
I cant sing it I feel like singin
I wanna fuckin sing cos Im happy
Yeah Im happy I got my baby back
Yo check it out
Some days I sit starin out the window watchin this world pass me by
Sometimes I think theres nothin to live for I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think Im crazy Im crazy oh so crazy
Why am I here am I just wastin my time?
But then I see my baby suddenly Im not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes oh no
Sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
Everyones leanin on me
Cos sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl keeps gettin older I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes cos they dont understand me
They just don t see my real side
I act like shit dont phase me inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby suddenly Im not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
Sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
Everyones leanin on me
Cos sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
But then she come back to me
Yeh and if I could sing Id keep singin this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes Id blow somethin as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her how proud I am that I got her?
God Im a daddy Im so glad that her mum didnt abort her
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
That Im a pistol packin drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cos theres a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder that gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife whos determined to make my life livin hell
But I handle it well given the circumstances Im dealt
So many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else
But the years that Ive wasted are nothin to the tears that Ive tasted
So heres what Im facin three felonies six years of probation
Ive went to jail for this woman Ive been to bat for this woman
Ive taken bats to people backs bent over backwards for this woman
Man I shoulda seen it comin whyd I stick my penis uppin?
Woulda ripped the pre nup if Id seen what she was fuckin
But fuck it its over theres no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby maybe the only lady that I adore Hailey
So sayonara try tomorrow nice to know ya
My babys travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
Its like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
Now it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
Everyones leanin on me
Cos my baby knows that her daddys a soldier
Nothin can take her from me
I told you I cant sing oh well I tried
Hailie remember when I said
If you ever need anything daddy will be right there?
Well guess what? Daddys here and I aint goin nowhere baby
I love you

Thanks to a __cf_email__ data-cfemaildadddcbbab hrefcdn-cgilemail-protectionemail protecteda for these lyrics.
Hi!  My name is.. what?  My name is.. who?
My name is.. scratches Slim Shady
Hi!  My name is.. huh?  My name is.. what?
My name is.. scratches Slim Shady
Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second?
Eminem
Hi kids!  Do you like violence?  Yeah yeah yeah!
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?  Uh-huh!
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?  Yeah yeah!
Try cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?  Huh?
My brains dead weight Im tryin to get my head straight
but I cant figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate  Ummmm..
And Dr. Dre said Slim Shady you a basehead!
Uh-uhhh!  So whys your face red?  Man you wasted!
Well since age twelve Ive felt like Im someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lees tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Cmere slut!  Shady wait a minute thats my girl dog!
I dont give a fuck God sent me to piss the world off!
Chorus
Eminem
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot next semester Ill be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers  Owwwwwwww!
Walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they screamin at me LETS JUST BE FRIENDS!
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do  Damn!
I told her Id grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her  Oh thank you!
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans  Aaahhhhhh!
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
Dude can I get your autograph?
So I signed it Dear Dave thanks for the support ASSHOLE!
Chorus
Eminem
Stop the tape!  This kid needs to be locked away!  Get him!
Dr. Dre dont just stand there OPERATE!
Im not ready to leave its too scary to die  Fuck that!
Ill have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Huh yup!  Am I comin or goin?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive?  Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Whoops!  Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk  hachhh-too
I spit when I talk Ill fuck anything that walks  Cmere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM?  WAH!
YOU AINT GOT NO TITS!  WAHHH!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  BANG!
Im steamin mad  Arrrggghhh! 
And by the way when you see my dad?  Yeah?
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Chorus
my name is edited versionMiscellaneousTheres an intruder in my house
He cut my phone-lines cant dial out
I scream for police but I doubt
Theyre gonna hear me when I shout
A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
Theres a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time when I get pulled over
Theres a Doberman Pinscher and a Pitbull in the seat
These pigsll get bit fooling with me
Quit fooling with me
Bitch youre gonna see
No pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when youre me
And which youre gonna see in the long run
Ima be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this Limo tinted glass
Flashin that flash-light on my ass where was you at?
Last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass
Rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What Im posed to fight with bear palms?
Yeah right
They coming with bombs Im comin with flare-guns
We as Americans
We as a Americans us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves livin up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means
We as Americans us as a citizen
We are Samaritans what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
Ima make Vuku bucks wearin Vuku vests
Drama hanging over my head like a Voodoo Hex
I couldve been next to fly over the cuckoos nest
But you know who with an S tattooed to my chest
But Ive innested now I got the Industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty its funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker
Than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money I dont rap for dead presidents
Id rather see the president dead
Its never been said
But I said precedents and the standards
And they cant stand it
My name shouldve been bastard
The shit shouldve been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp
I shouldve been blasted
I shouldve been had a cap pulled in my ass
But Im too swift and fast for that Im past it
Im too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit
I done seen a fastest rap shit
And turning into some pap-pap shit
That quick snap click
But this time they got fucking automatic
And no one gon test this mon clack
We as a Americans us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves livin up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means
We as Americans us as a citizen
We are Samaritans what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
Under my Long Johns under my Sean Johns
When running with the long arm or the long long gone
Ima do five years or less than that
No questions asked
It might be a good idea to stop right here
And quit while Im ahead already in the red
Already got a steady infrared nipped on my head
A target on my back bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass he probably gone send a task
I aint gone even ask they aint gone let me pack
They aint gone gimme my semi but I got my whizz at
We as a Americans us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves livin up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means
We as Americans us as a citizen
We are Samaritans what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
we as americansbonus cdscratched sample - Im the man!
I stand in ?? by the way as i begin
Do you know who I am? and may reply with a grin
Yes Im tired of being ??
Why should I be secluded I got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell Eminem will you kick it for me?
So I find myself in a certain ??depligatory??
A place where I dwell in ?? for some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time ??
Finally let loose unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile I aim like a reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?
Is there a reason for this? the hatred is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize youre fading?
Fading from existence cause simulations are dead
Theres so much more to learn it pages left to be readSo put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor
While I hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one
scratched sample - Yeah Its another..
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred
But then Im finally about to put an end to the hatred
The world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling
Oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do?
You cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to
The outcome we want ?? nothing ?? despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
Youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and
Youre dull its time you faced this here taste this
Straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth the deliverence of a starchild
Rest with formidable talent and versitility
But with such a power there comes a responsibilty
To infridge on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refuser abusin its accepted now its a trend
scratched sample - Yeah Its another...
You know I dont understand why we all just cant get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No? so then why do you speak for me 
and every other white man when you that were your enemy?
On the floor lies a broken door cause Im not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But Ive ?? apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite now see it being re-enacted
Pull up the ?? quickThese ?? we hate him these ?? are past us huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spots already occupied and I dont play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine
But Im always having to proove myself time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and hes put last
And ??bluffing?? with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin
And mutterin words with no meaning attack me side Im like ??Danny KDanny Kane??
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
and eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please
Ive got a craving
scratched sample until end - Im the man
crackers n cheeseMiscellaneousSo Im out the game huh?
Huh? echoes Yo Dre WE RIDIN?
Whatever
Haha! Well Im witcha homies
Okaylets handle the small shit
I was born to brew up storms and stir up shit
Kick up dust CUSS til I slur up spit
Grew up - too quick went through too much do too much shit
Corrupt and Im a pour it on like syrup bitch
Thick and rich sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk the shit for what its worth
Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
Poof And if I fumble the verse keep goin
First take I make mistakes just keep it
No punches pulled no punches thats weak shit
Fake shit if I ever take shit Ill EAT shit
Wasnt for him wouldnt be shit
Creep wit me as we take a lil trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I aint got to lie about my age
But what about Jermaine? Fuck Jermaine
He dont belong speakin mine or Timbalands name
And dont think I dont read
Your lil interviews and see what youre sayin
Im a giant and I aint gotta move til Im provoked
When I see you Ima step on you and not even know it
You midget Mini-Me with a bunch of little Mini-Yous
Runnin around your backyard swimmin pools
Over  million records sold
And I aint have to do it with ten or eleven-year-olds
Cause what you say is what you say say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin it just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
Second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie Cup if you ever mix me up
Or CONFUSE ME with a Canibus or Dre with a DUPRI
Well rub it in every club youre in will have you
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain
Dre aint havin itlong as Im here to play Devils Advocate
If there was some magic shit
I could wave over the industry that could save it when Im gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldntnot even if I could
From the hood and Im a hornet
And Ima only sting when Im cornered
And Ima only sucka punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebodys fuckin head off
Cause I know if they get up I wont get a chance to let off
Another punch Im punk rock no ones punk
Dont give a FUCK! White Pac so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill
And grow up to be Atilla go nuts and be a pillar
And Im somethin of a phenom
One puff of the chron Im unstoppable
Im alive and on top again
Theres no obstacle that I cant conquer
So come along with us come on!
Cause what you say is what you say say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin it just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows Im about fast cars and Alize partyin all day
But I handle my business cause its work before play
Dont look for trouble but Ill serve you gourmet
However you want it you can have it your way
You fuck my night up Ima fuck up your day
Bullet with your name sendin it your way clack
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Cause this is my space you invade it live to regret it
And you die tryin to violate it
Fuck around get annihilatedeyes dilated
Heh like my old lady
Cause what you say is what you say sometimes what you mean
Is two different things dependin on your mood if it swings
Think too many things
Little hit of Dres weed I can do anything
Catch a contact then Im gone and Im back
I speed rightand my looseleafs my launchpad
And I can pull any string
Dont have to prove anything catch a contract on your head
You headed West talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest and invest
In somethin to protect your head and neck
And its back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say Im best
In the booth but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
Ima die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source? Aint holdin my fuckin breath
But Ill suffocate for the respect
Fore Ill breathe to collect a fuckin check
Cause what you say is what you say say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin it just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh?
Watch your fuckin mouth
Yo this Timbaland tell them I said suck chka MY dick
say what you sayThe Eminem Show.
Oh my goodness what have I done?
Oh no I cant believe it
Its like Ive got the whole world in my palm
And Im ready to drop bombs
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca
Its the village in New York right next to the TriBeCa
Thats my sector homosexual dissector
Come again rewind selector
I said nice rectum I had a vasectomy Hector
So you cant get pregnant if I buy sex and erect ya
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less then  seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy
Well Im next to the guy with  ecstasy pills and  extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities
Why? Yes sir I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
Thats my kind of vibe what else should I try Lester?
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess Ill dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball youre all in
I said I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball youre in my medicine ball friends
All my West Side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy quief and blow it up
Man I think that Eggers fell off the tip didnt show enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man youve seen it all before youre all too familiar with it
Theres a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl dont front oh no you didnt
I wont rape all the Pussycat Dolls Nicole you kiddin?
Ill pee on Rihanna see man Ill do what I wanna
Spray perfume in a sauna room crazy gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man who wouldve thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chicks so old she looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you werent so defensive it wouldnt be youre so sensitive
I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball youre all in
I said I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball youre in my medicine ball friends
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here you need a hand big man?
Grab a hold of this branch with both hands

This name rhymes with so many different words geez
So one last time Mr. Christopher Reeves
Wont you break it down for me and just spit the verse please
Eminem Im coming to kill you
Always hated you and I still do
Youll never fill my shoes my Superman costume

Youre taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Lets break dance if you think youre hardcore
I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball youre all in
I said I guess its time for you to hate me again

I dont understand
Why are you being so mean?
Youre mean yo mean yeah man
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you you just cant do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cuz youre a meanie a meanie
But its only cuz youre just really jealous of me
Cuz Im what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz its too easy to see
Youre just a really big weenie big weenie
Alright listen I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
Im going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind your eyes close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why youre so fuckin jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo?
Hippity ca-ca boo-boo
Psych Im kidding
I just wanted to see if youre still listenin
Ok now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever theres conversation why am I always mentioned?
Ive been dying to ask its been itchin at me
Is it just because
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you you just cant do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cuz youre a meanie a meanie
But its only cuz youre just really jealous of me
Cuz Im what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz its too easy to see
Youre really just a big weenie big weenie
Alright now aww shit I I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was I fucked up
Psych Im kidding again you idiot no I didnt
Thats just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up aint it?
But I can bust one take without lookin at no paper
It doesnt take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth okay
Youre droolin you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open youre disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir what am I on?
You sir are on truth syrum
Marshall Im so jealous of you
Please say you wont tell nobody
Id be so embarrassed Im just absolutely terrified
That someones gonna find out why Im saying
All these terrible evil and awful mean things
Its my own insecurity
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you you just cant do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cuz youre a meanie a meanie
But its only cuz youre just really jealous of me
Cuz Im what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz its too easy to see
Youre just a really big weenie big weenie
Alright now we were going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cuz thats exactly what your eyes look like want to check to see?
Heres a mirror notice the resemblance here?
Wait let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror how about now?
What do you have in common?
Youre both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you I know youre not happy
I know youd much rather see me
Lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself its pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this
This is torturous my point is this
That if you say mean things weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is your just is
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you you just cant do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me

Theres never been this much of a menace in this game as this

Once again its the illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners this music is in us and its
Not over til we say its finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin this is hip hop when its in its
Truest form the greatest hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is or was still is
Whatever forever he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world what to do next
Hes already reconciled with his ex a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitchs desk strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap devil baby on crack
Resurrect I never left baby Im bad
Ive gone mad my comrade Drezy automatically
He says Im too broke to fix way beyond that
I may be off drugs but its made me off track
In fact this right here very well could be the last rap

Fuck it I quit suck on a dick jackass
Im done with this wack ass rap kiss my black ass  Cent

You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw a line on any fences
If so to what extensive
Any should I go? Cause its getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say that I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this
Far at other peoples expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
Its censorship and its down right blasphemous
Listen to shit now cause I wont stand for this
And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves wont sit for this neither
And lets clear this up too I aint got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those  cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like its my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman I killed Superman
And how ironic? That Id be the bad guy
Kryptonite the green chronic
Cause I aint got no legs
Or no brain nice to meet you
Hi my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course its intercourse and its bi-sexual sex
Which isnt as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after preforming the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by todays kids
In a more derogatory way but
Whos to say whats fair to say and what not to say?
Lets ask Dr. Dre Dr. Dre?
What up?
I gotta question if I may?
Yeah
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend
Yeah
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off?
Yeah
But ut! I aint done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown mans ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney but he didnt mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I dont mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Till then Ill just walk around with a manly strut because
Cause I aint got no legs
Or no brain nice to meet you
Hi my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
You find me offensive I find you offensive
Shit this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where is the goddamn beat?
Anyway anyway I dont know how else to put it
This is the only thing that Im good at
I am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
Demonic yep yep dont worry Im on it
I got it high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessicas head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon a
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and screw my
Head is straight back to the Neverland ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I dont gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didnt say shit
Cause I aint got no legs
Or no brain nice to meet you
Hi my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is

People it feels so good to be back
Mosh with me now
You scrutinize every word memorize every line
I spit it once refuel re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel its time
Its just all in your mind what you interpret it as
I say to fight you take it as Ima whip someones ass
If you dont understand dont even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a father-less past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin and jugglin both
Perhaps mastered his craft slash entrepreneur
Who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Whos had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure
Movin past that Mr. Kiss his ass crack
Hes a class act rubber band man yeah he just snaps back
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on give me hope give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon fight
We gon charge we gon stomp we gon march through the swamp
We gon mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors
Come on
All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all form this stomp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
No matter what color all that matters were gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains let it rain yeah the wetter the better
They aint gon stop us they cant were stronger now more then ever
They tell us No we say Yeah they tell us Stop we say Go
Rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gon let em know
Stomp push shove mush fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home cmon just
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on give me hope give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon fight
We gon charge we gon stomp we gon march through the swamp
We gon mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors
Come on
Imagine it pourin its rainin down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someones tryin to tell us somethin
Maybe this is God just sayin were responsible
For this monster this coward that we have empowered
This is Bin Laden look at his head noddin
How could we allow somethin like this
Without pumpin our fists now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it times it and multiply it by sixteen million
People are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a high anarchy
Strap him with a AK  let him go fight his own war
Let him impress Daddy that way
No more blood for oil we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare to trick us to thinkin that we aint loyal
If we dont serve our own country were patronizin a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies the stars and stripes have been swiped Washed out and wiped and replaced with his own face
Mosh now or die if I get sniped tonight
Youll know why â€~cuz I told you to fight
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on give me hope give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon fight
We gon charge we gon stomp we gon march through the swamp
We gon mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors
Come on
And as we proceed to mosh through this desert storm
In these closing statements if they should argue
Let us beg to differ as we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army to disarm this weapon
Of mass destruction that we call our President
For the present and mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard Mr. President Mr. Senator
moshEncore.

Intro ~Eminem~
Yeah!
Obie Trice
Obie the person that came up and deverted
Cause of nervousness. - That was solely the homies verdict.
It was worth it cause he changed became so I observed itCertain such of a purpose.
If you knew him earlier in his days its like a different version
So much hurtin and pain gave him game for certain.
Thats why theres curtains in his murder if you gettin worked upIm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin tougher.
I had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs doin the same in school.
Now look what he became! A foolCause he learned how to sustain his two and obtain fame from you?
Living hard but still Julliard
A god walks in but aint spent a day in a pew.
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga ventsSo welcome to the art department.
Eminem
I stimulate the brain mimick emulate a saint
Cynic keep em thinkin its a fuckin gimmick when it aint.
Clinically insane brain is on Venus suck Your-anus! Uranus!
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say
He may seem as though hes plain normal if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake see he aint as mean as what they say.
See the thing is maybe he cant always think of things to saySo hes vague. - So they mistake him for just bein crazed.
You part ways your impression of him changed you dont think hes strange?
You turn around and tell him Peace and thanks.
Then you catch him flippin you off with his pants down hands around his ScrotumTuckin his fuckin penis between his legs. AAAHHH!

Its all psychologic. - Why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick? bllabllablaaabbbb!
Or am I truly psychotic or are my molecules just diabolical?
Cause biologically - I defy logic.
By golly haul me off on a trolly
Proly want a crack Im back on that wacky tobacco.
Im a step away from Crack Obie smacked the shit outta me!
Im so slap happy man. Snap me back to reality!
Im a walkin art gallery. - A science museum.
Elephantiasis of the nuts youd probably die if you see em!
I pull em out they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance I cant just put em back in my pants. HELP ME!

Nail In The Coffin
Eminem
This motherfucker here just wont shut up will you? 
Talk about I owe you bitch you owe me 
Im promoting you right now 
Man lets put the nail in his coffin 
Chorus
I dont want to be like this 
I dont really want to hurt no feelins 
But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap 
Old men have heart attacks 
now I dont want to be responsible for that so 
Put the mic down and walk away 
You can still have a little bit of dignity 
verse 
I would never claim to be no great Benzino 
an  year old fake Pachino 
So how can he hold me over some balcony 
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me 
Please dont youl probably fall with me 
and our asses will both be history 
But then again youl finnally get your wish 
cuz you be all over the street like  Cent 
Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump 
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up 
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up 
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck 
dick in the industry swear that you in the streets hustlin 
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin 
and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearences 
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists 
dont even respect you or take you serious 
Its not that we dont like you we hate you - period 
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn 
last week you was shakin Obie Trices hand 
Now hes a busta? What the fucks with that? 
Get on a track dissin us kissin s ass 
and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me 
bitch I got two cases and probation - fight me! 
What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man 
ready to take whatever sentence he hands 
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists 
right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl? 
And I put that on her when this is all over 
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her 
I dont know shit about no shoppin rocks 
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots? 
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin 
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin 
them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos 
Just makin copys of your covers of casette singles 
and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer 
Spendin your whole paycheck at Disc Makers 
What you know about bein bullied over half your life? 
Oh thats right you know what thats like your half white 
Vanilla Icespill the beans and rice Im eaten you alive inside 
Jesus Christ if your that much of a gangster put the mic down 
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now 
Kill a motherfucker dead killem dead bitch 
Shootem in the fuckin head go ahead bitch 
Slap my mom slap the fck outa her! 
She cant sue you she wouldnt get a buck out of you 
Cuz your broke as fuck you suck your a fuckin joke 
If you was really sellin coke well then what the fuck 
you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack 
youd make alot more money than you do from rap 
You never had no security youll never be famous 
Youl never now what its like to be rich lifes a bitch aint it? 
Raymond here let me break this shit down in lamens 
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this 
and Canibus they usin too many complicated fuckin words for you 
Here then let me slow it down for you 
so you can understand if I say it slower 
Let it go dawg its over 
Chorus
Eminem talkin
Haha 
Talkin bout I have motherfuckers callin your crib 
bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib 
You aint even got a fuckin phone fuckin bum 
Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin Source magazine

and big ben taught charlie b moore to deep throat

Welcome back to the stage of history
Eminem
Yo.. Slim Shady!
Yo.. Ill fuckin.. Ill..
Ill puke eat it and freak you eww
Battle? Im too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you em both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
Ill lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse 
youll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
Bitch! I aint no fuckin G Im a cannibal 
I aint tryin to shoot you 
Im tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers ahhh!
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis
Im so bananas Im showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while I sit back and just hope it catches 
Blow you to fragments
Laugh roll you and smoke the ashes
Chorus J-Black repeat X
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me is this hell were livin in?
If so heavens got to be better
But if were hellbound whatever lets go down
J-Black
Am I the worst? Because I never go to church never
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
Ima drink til my liver rot see the doc
Leave the E.R. then hit a bar for a liquor shot til the liver spot
One day we all gon die
But when I die Ima be so high
that Ima get up and walk leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but its just a rock
Now if I pray everynight night
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke I drink I curse and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line wearin a Nordface
Nickle nine at my waist God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I dont reply back
Just show me to my quarters and oh yeah wheres Thai at?
Chorus 
Announcer
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle fight!
Masta Ace
Analyze the strength of my game like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul with a vest on my torso
And of course yo yall know Im no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older and more colder
Fly you to Colorado roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you wont dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just dont care

Chorus ~Eminem~
Theres no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just wont listen will ya nah I guess not
You just cant can ya man I cant stand ya
Youre rotten what you plottin for us?
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse fore they get better
Verse 
Holy toledo its Angelina Jolie amigo
She told me yo Shady just hand your penis to me Ill deep throat
And Brad if you try to stand between us then were gonna see bro
Who was a fantasy I dont mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna rassle I shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed lexapro broken up with the capsule or paxil
Just incase I aint dope enough with the raps though
Coke is cut with tobacco
Smoke it up then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco
Shady let go the hoe has been choked up enough
Let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
Im off my fucking meds but Im on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jasons face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar
They cant even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now Im gone get the rectal thermometer get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cause
Chorus ~Eminem~
Theres no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
B.o.B
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up geez
Theres no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down?
And I will never let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse fore they get better
Verse  ~B.o.B~
With the soul of a Sharman
I leave the beat than vomit
Like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
Its probably go diseases on it
Im just being honest I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters I dont need the money
I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
Somebody tell these girls please release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin back watching Earth from my Space station
Chorus ~Eminem~
Theres no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just wont listen will ya nah I guess not
You just cant can ya man I cant stand ya
Youre rotten what you plottin for us?
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse fore they get better
Verse  ~Eminem~
Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bendingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
Its like I got ya hypnotising like I gotcha
I gotcha pychologically fucked
I would like an apology what
Tell that psycho to stick a tyco and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
Im as cold as a motherfucking icicle on my nut
I aint nuttin nice man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post tramatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic Ive been in a while
This is the closest that its come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I dont paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This aint your orphan Annie no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning
He cant say whore
Of course he can man he just saw her fanny then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties
Chorus ~Eminem~
Theres no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just wont listen will ya nah I guess not
You just cant can ya man I cant stand ya
Youre rotten what you plottin for us?
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse fore they get better
things get worse epStraight From The Vault EPOne two one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture yall
Brought to you by the world famous wake-up show
Bobby Steels Staple tails MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist piercin holes in you
You cant escape  kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped parks pops his trunk snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M- in your face cops stop give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up
When I woke up I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the Gs in Cali locked up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds Killer Clown is comin
Look around your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the Midwest leavin MCs lipless
On the Wake-Up Show make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna you cant fuck wit the sniper
Your flows premature clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno chryo-gat flow guru and aint nobody tighter
Sway amp Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling Tech NNEs filled
This place is my house I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cuz yall cant see me like Mases eyebrows
Where you at?
Climped out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
Hey thats my couch bitch pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While Im rippin this shit put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
Youre tied down and duct-taped fuck rape
Id rather just hump a sluts leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway amp Tech two disk jockeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject
Lo and behold better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand a man thats never gon fold
Cuz your tape sucks find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech amp Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high-noon to the full moon
Wit synonyms I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck leave a little piece of flesh
So the head wont fall off hauled-off sawed-off shotgun blast he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
Oh huh C now like Omar Credle we pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway Tech and DJ Revolution
I sway the tech wit the Tech amp Sway
Step away wet and spray rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away
Flood up the street wit bloody decora
Until the head of Jake investigate
What? Sway can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it?
Tech can give it to you but whatcha gon do?
Rev can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it
I can give it to you wha wha wha what what?
Yo yo Chino makes the world go round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk poison pen hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time the most commonest thought
The drama thats brought caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance theres nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
Youre wack like Will Smith your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg
You shouldnt have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
Im Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway amp Tech
My tecs like Tekken the industry weapon
Im Chino X bring KRS in
De de de de de de da di day KRS-One comin wit the Tech amp Sway
Yo I rock up the littlest set and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But Im willin to bet on a Sway amp a Tech
They stay in effect never been a pain in the neck they gainin respect
Nevertheless I wreck you now you know what Sway amp Tech do
Ill be back but for now just sackle
Fresh for ninty-nine you suckas
the anthemMiscellaneousSkylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica
Wait a minute you hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other
Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No Roger thats not what I want to do
I love her! And were going to be together
Never

b rabbit on the roof topMiscellaneousIntro
Yeah yeah I get it
I run this rap shit now guess whos back
You thought I left you now why would I do that?   
Verse
They keep on sayin the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West maybe theyre just tryna distract it
From the fact that Im comin back
Or maybe its cause I aint black maybe its because of that
Maybe its because Im the highest sellin artist in rap
While Im sittin back in my office jackin off to my plaques
Im still sick how can I be sick this long
And Im still alive Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin my opponents think that Ive died
Thats when I just pop up outta nowhere oh yeah there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of Saint-Tropez but your man dont lay
In the sun cause I dont tan I burn blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money weve earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 
And coulda retired at  in my ′s still
And Fif here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he aint even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more oh boy goddamn did he score
To go from sellin bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us we make pay
Im just a super easy modest MC okay?
Til I hear the word has been thats when I start spazzin
Smart asses kiss a smarter ass then
Im the best thing that ever happened to rap bastards
Im a blonde Dre now gimme Kanyes glasses!

Motherfucker comes out
I never knew I
And sells a couple of million records
I never knew I
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
I never knew I
I dont do black music I dont do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit you probably think Im in your tape deck now
Im in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down waitin to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth and grab you by the face what now?
Oh you want me to watch my mouth how?
Take my fuckin eyeballs out and turn em around
Look Ill burn your fuckin house down circle around
And hit the hydrant so you cant put your burnin furniture out
Im sorry there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that take drugs rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs men who wear make up
Get aware wake up get a sense of humor
Quit tryin to censor music this is for your kids amusement
But dont blame me when lil Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin him apparently you aint parents
Cause I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew Id effect this kid
I never knew Id get him to slit his wrist
I never knew Id get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew Id effect this kid
I never knew Id get him to slit his wrist
I never knew Id get him to hit this bitch
So whos bringin the guns in this country?
I couldnt sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where hes shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids up in the front row
Screamin Go with their seventeen year old uncle
Im like Guidance aint they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught em to swear
What about the make up you allow your twelve year old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesnt know any cuss words
When his bus drivers screamin at him fuckin him up worse
And Fuck was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade flippin the gym teacher the bird
So read up about how I used to get beat up
Peed on be on free lunch and change school every three months
My lifes like kinda what my wifes like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
Cause I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew Id effect this kid
I never knew Id get him to slit his wrist
I never knew Id get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew Id effect this kid
I never knew Id get him to slit his wrist
I never knew Id get him to hit this bitch I never knew Id

A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I dont got that bad of a mouth do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt shooby de doo wop

How many retardsll listen to me?

Wasnt me Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man Im just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes who woulda thought?
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it I aint know if youd do it or not
Cause I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew Id effect this kid
I never knew Id get him to slit his wrist
I never knew Id get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew Id effect this kid
I never knew Id get him to slit his wrist
I never knew Id get him to hit this bitch

Life by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you gotten past it
Its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Moneyll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down
What is life?
Im tired of life
Im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
Im tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
Im tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
Im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
Im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wanders why Im smartin off
Im tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
Im tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand Id make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while Im on the John
If I had a million bucks it wouldnt be enough because Id still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
Im tired of being white trash broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
Im tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM
Tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a contour
Im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Im tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
Saying they wasnt feeling me when nobodys as ill as me
And Im tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying Where Hip-Hop Lives
But if I had a million dollars
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand Id make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while Im on the john
If I had a million bucks it wouldnt be enough because Id still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
You know what Im saying?
Im tired of all of this bullshit telling me to be positive
How am I supposed to be positive when I dont see shit positive?
You know what Im sayin? I rap about shit around me shit I see
You know what Im sayin? Right now Im tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating thats going on in my own city
Cant get no airplay you know what Im sayin?
But ey its cool though you know what Im sayin?
Just fed up
Thats my word

Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges peach pears plums syringes

And never even seen me blink get me bustin a sweat
People steppin over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so levy?
Turn on these beats MCs dont see me

Verse
When I pull out up front you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll  deep its  knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes they wanna fuck 
But homie aint nothing change hold down Gs up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move youll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying  you hot
They like me I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York them niggasll tell ya im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
Im feelin focused man my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and Im still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

A lot of people think that what I say on records
Or what I talk about on a record that I actually do in real life
Or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that

Well shit if you believe that then Ill kill you
You know why?

Criminal

Or the homosex hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress hate fags? The answers Yes
Homophobic? Nah youre just heterophobic
Starin at my jeans watchin my genitals bulgin
Thats my motherfuckin balls youd better let go of em
They belong in my scrotum youll never get hold of em
Hey its me Versace whoops somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin the mail get it? Checkin the male?
How many records you expectin to sell

Cmon! Relax guy I like gay men
Right Ken? Give me an Amen
Amen!
Please Lord this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child help us destroy these demons
Oh and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wifes sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher fifth grade teacher
You cant reach me my mom cant neither
You cant teach me a goddamn thing ause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you aint able to stop these thoughts
You cant stop me from toppin these charts
And you cant stop me from droppin each March
With a brand new cd for these fuckin retards
Duh and to think its just little ol me
Mr. Dont Give A Fuck still wont leave

Coz every time I write a rhyme these people think its a crime
To tell em whats on my mind I guess Im a criminal
But I dont gotta say a word I just flip em the bird

Coz every time I write a rhyme these people think its a crime
To tell em whats on my mind I guess Im a criminal
But I dont gotta say a word I just flip em the bird
And keep goin I dont take shit from no one
My mother did drugs tar liquor cigarettes and speed
The baby came out disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Dont dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
Im a criminal an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you werent raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than youd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word
My morals went when the President got oral sex
In his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now dont ignore me you wont avoid me
You cant miss me Im white blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it aint happened to him
Slim Shady Im as crazy as
Eminem and Kim combined the maniacs in
Replacin the doctor cause Dre couldnt make it today
Hes a little under the weather so Im takin his place
Oh thats Dre with an AK to his face
Dont make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre you shouldve kept that thang put away
I guess thatll teach you not to let me play with it eh?
Im a criminal
Aight look uh huh just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight

What? Oh my God dont kill me
Im not gonna kill you bitch quit lookin around
Dont kill me please dont kill me
I said Im not gonna fuckin kill you
Hurry the fuck up!
Thank you!
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank run out and just dive in it
So Ill be disguised in it and if anybody identifies the guy in it
Ill hide for five minutes
Come back shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches bastards brats pets
This puppys lucky I didnt blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck Id shave my nuts
Tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin chickens aint brave enough
To say the stuff I say so just tape it shut
Shit half the shit I say I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if its not a rapper that I make it as
Ima be a fuckin rapist in a Jason mask
Im a criminal
Coz every time I write a rhyme these people think its a crime
To tell em whats on my mind I guess Im a criminal
But I dont gotta say a word I just flip em the bird

Chorus ~Just Blaze~
Some people ask me where I’ve been lately
They thought I fell off nobody could save me
I play in the background I don’t back down
So don’t get it twisted tryna play me
First I come out they underate me
Then I come back still try to fade me
They say I’m nasty say I’m crazy
Ask what I think I say maybe
I fly away
It ain’t nothin in my way so I may aswell fly away
It ain’t nothin else to say so I may aswell fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today
Cos I’ve been to the top and there’s nowhere else to go
The only way to see me is if you lookin’ up from down below
And there’s nothin’ else to say so I may aswell fly away
And there’s nothin’ in my way so I may aswell fly away
I’m on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away
Verse  ~Eminem~
Got my self esteem back got my confidence up
I’ma step up on the stage now I’m gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt
And you aint gotta tell me notin’ boy get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money two for the show
My shit don’t stink I dont think so
Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll
Are you ready now here we go
The bald eagle has landed
I’m back in ya hair sorry for leavin’ you stranded
Im twice as dread and evil and rancid
They cant sit I don’t think anybody understands it
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands its playdough
I aint got to play though they say I died in a fatal
Car crash shows what they know
Shit if I did it’d be a trailer not a car
The white trash star
I fuckin RV up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards your dippin your soup inside ya crackers
I can carry rap til my back hurts
Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors
Get my back right
Now I’m right back on you bastards
I was chasin’ the dragon I dont know what happened
It was like the feelin’ I had when I first started rappin’
I just could’nt seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab thats where I’ve been at when...
Chorus ~Just Blaze~

I took a hiatus haters now I’m back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
Im the bang you aint fuckin sick
The hospital won’t even give you cough drops for course cocksucker
You think your hot you aint even luke warm
My pubes hotter than you
Your soft I use fire to cool me off
I told em I’ll grow up one day and show ‘em I’d be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightenin’ bolts and throw ‘em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgie porgie kissed the girls make the girls cry for em
Make ‘em swarm make ‘em fight over the shirts I’ve worn
Sworn over my sweat towels its mind blowin
Yes Im livin’ the dream homie cant nothin’ compare
I’m so up I’m stuck in mid air I’m lovin’ it yeah
Its like these people are steps now all they do is stare
These haters is so pussy they’re afraid to be scared
This is pay back like I owe ‘em back pay
They spat in my face now I’m back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad tasteAnd slap it back out before I step back out of this crap thanks
Slap me now I’m slapping ‘em back hey! fuck it we’ll slap back
But yeh okay now we’ll talk cause I’m smack ay
And I aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack
How’s that for hindsight what the track say?

Comin Out My Closet parody
Intro
Wheres my penis?
I have no penis in my butt hole - there you go
Yeah.. yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have Ive been penetrated and ejaculated against
Rammin’ shafts up my faggot ass look at my brass
Ever since class I’ve been suckin’ off my teachers to pass
All this cum motion unloadin run deep as oceans explodin’
Nut keeps splashin’ from faggots just suck em off and keep goin’
Nut-takin’ bummer I’m known as to every one in my region
Keep stickin’ ass in the mornin’ and takin’ cocks in the evenin’
Leaves me with a taste as sour as seminal in my mouth
See they can bugger me but y’all never figured me out
Look at me now you know I got a dick in me now. 
Blame my momma?
She was the fattest slut in the house!
Chorus 
Im sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
Im comin’ out my closet one more time
I said Im sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
Im comin’ out my closet
Ha! I got some vibrators in my closet
and I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Ima expose it Ill take you back to 
before I ever had to worry about the HIV
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father used to put his willy up in my bum
cause he split my anal cherry then he came in my eye
And lookin’ back on it all now I fuckin’ wish I could die
I look at gays see and try to picture their bare behinds
Even if I hated men  Id grit my teeth and Id try
to make it work with ‘em at least for papas sake
He maybe made some mistakes
but he’s the only gay who taught me everything that I know today
What he did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit he did was put a condom on his king dong
’Cuz heda killed me shit he woulda shot cum in my throat
Its my life Id like to welcome yall to The Batty Boy Show
Repeat Chorus 
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin’
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin’ your momma gobblin’ Mormon missionaries in the kitchen
Bitchin’ that someones always pullin’ down her drawers and clits itchin’
Goin’ through public whorehouse systems victim of crack-controlled pimpin’
My whole life I was made to believe I was straight when I wasnt
til I grew up now I do what you did I’m sick to my stomach
guzzlin’ it
Wasnt it the reason you gave that VD to me MA?
So you can try but can’t deny the way you treated me MA?
But guess what? Youre gettin’ Alzheimer’s now brain dead and alone too
And your care home security’s gettin’ lax you’re gonna know when I bone you
My asshole’s gettin’ so big now you should see it its beautiful
But youll never see it – ‘til I shit on you at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is when I take cocks that are long
Rips through my thong - keep tellin’ myself its all cuz’a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
You selfish bitch I fought fuckin’ long and hard for these dicks
Remember when Elton came out gay and you said you’re glad it’s not me? 
Well guess what I +AM+ gay - gay as a faggot can be!

You niggaz could scream holla and curse
Go ahead respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse
Verse  ~Proof~
Slim didnt send Proof to get into +Wankstas+
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas

Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
Its real business yall aint caught the concept bitch

Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggaz heard and they aint scurred to bust
Verse  ~Kon Artis~
Yo props to my nigga Bugz punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater

Your chest like a little wooden box
When I press tight on the trigger of this glock

No honey you guys are the same size
doe ray me feat d obie triceMiscellaneousMotherfuckers say that Im foolish I only talk about jewels
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See Im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin I made somethin doin
What I do through and through and I give you the news
With a twist its just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
Mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
Knocked down by some clown when Child Support knocked
No hes not around now how that sound to ya jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
Hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?
I help them see they way through it not you
Cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
Since Im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I aint no politician but Ill kick it with em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits Ill wear it
But if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
Usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
But theres a huge interference theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
Maybe its hatred I spew maybe its food for the spirit
Maybe its beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But Im debated disputed hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin drug addict like you didnt experiment?
Now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do-gooders too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I dont think you do so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go hes jigga joint jigga chk jigga
And Im the sinister Mr. Kiss My Ass
Its just a renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade never been afraid to talk
About anything anything anything anything
Renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade never been afraid to holler
About anything anything anything anything
I had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
Gotta vent lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent bring dollars in
By the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
Do not step to me Im awkward I box lefter often
My pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
Could not stress to me I wasnt grown specially on nights
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it multi before I die
No lie just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
See Im a poet to some a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these latter day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that aint the case see its a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shadys as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See its easy as cake simple as whistlin Dixie
While Im wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons
Take a bath with the Catholics in holy water
No wonder they try to hold me under longer
Im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? Im just a kid from the gutter
Makin his butter off these bloodsuckers
Cause Im a muhfuckin renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade never been afraid to talk about
Anything anything anything anything
Renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade never been afraid to holler about
Anything anything anything anything
Renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade never been afraid to talk about
Anything anything anything anything
Renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade never been afraid to holler about
Anything anything anything anything
renegade original underground versionMiscellaneousIm a goat
And for those of yall who dont know what a goat is
It means the greatest of all time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much here it goes!
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And Im in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyones telling me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And Im not sure how this is gonna come off
Theyre probably gonna think that Im coming off as cocky haha
Like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
See the thing about me
Is you dont really know a thing about me
Everyones making a stink about me
Like theres some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers
And the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like Im more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin neighbors
But see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
Why does it seem like Im not even put up in the same category as other emcees?
So when Weezy says that hes better than Jay-z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jiggas the best and that hes
The only one up in that league see
And its easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowing god damn well that Im one of the best god damn rappers that ever lived period
Im a goat
and I dont mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazinesll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much here it goes!
Maybe they figure that Im on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
or a new Shady if they think its gonna happen
man I thought I was crazy
or maybe I could be takin it wrong and theyre tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Walls white
cause lyrically he doesnt pose a threat to anyone see hes just aight
and Bubba Sparxxx he just wont write
because hes so caught up in that snow white
that Timbaland cant even get him in the studio
hes so gone off that coke right
and its so sad cause hes dope right
Americas next great white hope right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show right
and which Im still havin mixed feelings about
they said itd be real Im just spillin it out
theres somethin about a white boy talking black and runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth
and I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
Isnt it ironic that the best rappers white and the best golfers black?
and Im the one whos gotta catch all the flack offa that
but these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until  Mile had came out
but I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin me now
when suddenly I wasnt such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me mustve died
thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
and ? God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
and Angelina Jolie is just another ho
and Brad is a sucka because once I fuck her
she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
you know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you want a Shady? Well you got it man
I aint apologizin for shit.
Im a goat
and I dont mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazinesll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much here it goes!
Man Im takin my ball and goin home man
shit is too easy
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
Im a goat
so dont worry Im out the motherfuckin game
and yall can sit and argue about whos the motherfuckin best
but yall know that
Im a goat
and like I said Im one of the motherfuckin best
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin bunch
but before I go Id like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasnt there from the start
and thank you very much to everybody who was
and yall aint gotta say it just think it
cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know
Im a goat
hahahaha
Im out yall

Im tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin everywhere and niggas is wildin
Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin
This chick is clingin onto me sobbin and sighin
Sayin she didnt mean to diss me earlier and she cryin
But its real and its on and cats is gettin killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now shes yellin

I told her Id be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape

Ima meet you at the club we gon fuck these hoes up
One shot two shot three shots four shots all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door somebodys lickin shots off
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin outside the door waitin in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D perform
The fire marshalls know the venues too small
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of em off
Missed who hes aimin for six feet aways the door
Into St. Andrews hall now the strays flyin all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
Im posted up at the bar havin a mazel tov
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God Im alive I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
No I guess not what the fuck oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I cant pull her
Goddamn there just went another damn bullet Im hit
My vest is barely able to handle it its too thin
If I get hit again I cant do it I scoop deep
Follow Bizarres path ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin it out
But I cant see who hes shootin it out with
But Denauns right behind him squeezin his four fifth
One shot two shot three shots four shots all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door somebodys lickin shots off
Its Friday night came to this bitch right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I aint come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight
Although I cant stay here to fight cuz Im poppin niggas tonight
Thats right bitches Im drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka
So one shot for the money twos to stop the show
Thirds for the bartender
Theres plenty of shots to go
I just wanna know whos drivin a black Mitsubishi
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece
One shot two shot three shots four shots all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops bodies drop hit the floor musics off
Party stops everybody hit the door somebodys lickin shots off
one shot  shotEncore.
Wahoo guess whos back?
Mommy were home
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs Soul Assassins Cypress Hill
Everybody put your hands where my eyes can see
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans they knowing when D-Bo was 
Tweezy Obie there wont be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas back up to Los Angeles
Weve changed the way we move so man up if you cant adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
Its funny I guess money does have its advantages
And it isnt that we just think that we cant be touched
Its not like were just feeling ourselves that much
Its just that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that yall aint gon be the one whos gon do it
Cause first of all youre pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around get caught in a spot that you shouldnt be at
That you got no business being in we aint even gon be in it
No ones gunna hear nothing no ones gunna see this shit
And theyll be in and up out of it them boys is bout it bout it
The noise from unverified be drowned out by the crowd
And youll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes and clears out
And thats when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldnt stop yapping and took it past rapping
It aint about the music no more its bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off
Shits about to change cause we aint playing no games
We aint budging neither are they we aint saying no names
Shit just aint the same when the Aks gettin sprayed
Cause hip hop is in a state of 
It aint about hip hop cause those days are gone
It aint about trying rip shots to get props no more
Its about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip hop is in a state of 
Step off my holster cause shit its getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat yo son Im curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken so live it up you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what youve done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one spraying you bitches till there is none
Im like a rolling stone homie I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches for envy and all my riches
Your games just like a midget youre clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath people thats how we live it cmon
About to change cause we aint playing no games
We aint budging neither are they we aint saying no names
Shit just aint the same when the Aks gettin sprayed
Cause hip hop is in a state of 
It aint about hip hop cause those days are gone
It aint about trying rip shots to get props no more
Its about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip hop is in a state of 
Uh gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip hop this function is where did it
When I put it in motion my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you stumbling for cover this music dying in numbers
But you wouldnt pause and wonder admitting its all glamor
When you enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit your bitches they aint shit
We gangstas we blast first ask questions later
All these imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to save hip hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught Im not telling or more like killing not caring
Im riding a gangsta feeling no fearing when gangstas dying
Im in a full circle with homies thats supposed to bleed
On an  Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.s
About to change cause we aint playing no games
We aint budging neither are they we aint saying no names
Shit just aint the same when the Aks gettin sprayed
Cause hip hop is in a state of 
It aint about hip hop cause those days are gone
It aint about trying rip shots to get props no more
Its about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip hop is in a state of

CHORUS
My friends have told me
Its all around me
The signs of you guys
Being there too
I know it might be
A little Crazy
Its true without it
You wouldnt be you
I miss the times when we were
About 
We used to run around
Play around
It  was happier then
I still know you guys now
But youre not the same
I used to like it when
Our lives were a game
REPEAT CHORUS
Ive got some new friends
Youd really like them
I cant help but
Think about when
The games were over
Into a uniform
Still inside me
The thought of you is warm
I really miss you
Wanna hug and kiss you
And
REPEAT CHORUS
The time is messing up
I feel like dressing up
It makes it harder
To realise it
REPEAT CHORUS X
I really miss you
Wanna hug and kiss you
Its me and you

b rabbit vs diffusionMiscellaneousThis kind of music use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you cant refuse it
Its just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you dont have to ask who produced it
You just know thats the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin stupid
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin like Boones Farm
Hidin under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief thatll steal from his own moms
Connivin Kon Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin Lets get it on
A lush that love to drink drunk drivin a tank
Rollin over a bank cops see me and faint
Its drastic Im past my limit of coke
I think Ill up my high by slittin your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street til its mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music
You know why my hands are so numb? No
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didnt come oh
Smacked this whore for talkin crap bitch
So what if shes handicapped the bitch said Bizarre couldnt rap
I fuckin hate you Ill take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you hell yeah
Satan done got me on this song
Eatin a hot dog readin the Holy Quran while Im on the John
Tired of wearin this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo you know where it belongs thong thong thong
Now heres a gun Ill put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hills arms fuck your love songs
This kind of music use it and you get amped to do shit

Just bring who you gon bring on who you gon swing on?
Im King Kong guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-s and one pump click-clack
The snub in my paw shove it in your jaw
Have you runnin out this fuckin club in your drawers
We lovin the broads theres nothin to applaud
But fuck it its all good the hood is up in The Source its fight music
Im a nigga that loves scuffles
And wont hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
Im like that catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin You hear that?
I slap your freak bump you and wont speak
If you step on my feet you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin came back and fucked up
His pallbearers and made em drop his coffin its fight music
These beads Im swingin is stingin em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club Im bringin em
If any nigga lookin too hard we Rodney King n em
Malice green to them and gasolinin em with premium
Light a cigarette flick it at em or spit it at em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin right when your wifes lookin
Fuck fight music bitch this is losin your life music
If I could capture the rage of todays youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but dont say shit
You Liberaces Versaces and you Nazis
Watch me cause you thinkin you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me cause youre not me
Youll never stop me Im top speed as you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise em cause theyre lazy
To grow to praise me Im makin em go crazy
Thats how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think Ima admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic Im sicd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to and its called
This kind of music use it and you get amped to do shit

Its rolling
Yeah yeah yeah Dr. Dre up in here
Yall know what this is
Its what yall been waiting for Funk Master Flex Big Kap
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby
I used to be a lonely man only mad until I got a million dollars shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair Id pull it faster than a bullet
Out of Tupacs chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
Im trying to grow it back again it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it aint latching and cant lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cells padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it
My head is aching Im dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation?
Come on
Anyway I got down with Dre
What up?
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming Fuck the Police
When you still had your mothers fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
Fucking baby
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo
Hell yeah I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick bitch
Im sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I wont
Cause youll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots aint tough you just get drunk and become talkative
Wanna Fight?
Im probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I aint buzzed Im juss high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers Slim Shady
Dr. Dre
Im drunk pass the tec
Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving off and on Eminem is on
Off and on Dr. Dre is on
Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving off and on Eminem is on
Off and on Dr. Dre is on
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych Im just joking for Christ sake
Dont get so bent out of shape
Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just dont get it but I wont let it upset me
Cause they dont know better
They dont know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers youre down and wont get up
My minds got a mind of its own
sometimes I cant find it at home it hides in the stove
Hello where you at?
Shit talk about your brain being baked
My shits still in the oven on  De-Grades
Hailey Jade daddy loves you baby
Dont ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize
Individuals lives through a criminals eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
Ill have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Dont ever tell me what I can and what I cant say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck whos buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it Im tired bitch Im dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now its all commercial now
Its like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic its like the night get silent
Either that or booed thats why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
Im sick of being judged fuck it let me see a judge
Ill confess to every murder I committed since  years old
Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving off and on Eminem is on
Off and on Dr. Dre is on
Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving off and on Eminem is on
Off and on Dr. Dre is on
Fuck that turn that shit off

Never Enough
Eminem
Theres not much you could do or say to phase me
People think Im a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles even occasionally Doc Dre-ziell
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers finally wouldnt know how to take me
If they heard some shit Id lay the tape fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz I say so many rhymes it may seem like Im goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when Im pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates Ill be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
Im thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And Im thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You aint gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake G
Youre only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit youve been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now dont pussy out and try to wimp out face me
Cuz Ive been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see
Chorus x Nate Dogg
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I end up
Ooh ooh its never enough
 Cent
My flows untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it
The spot my talk it blaze a direct hit
Graze it your peace talk save it
You shit sounds dated youre overrated
Im obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
If Im the best and the worst then Gods gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy you payin attention boy?
I spit shit slick shit so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug press play you aint gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it roll a bag of the chocolate
Get your high over and over but you gotta cop it
When its hot its hot
Your hatin is undeniable stop it

Yeah ya know? Critics man
Critics never got nothin nice to say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man?
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well Imma tell em
Yesterday my dog died I hog tied a ho tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo
Im so tired of this I could blow fire in the hole
Im fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin a spider in the snow
So ya better get to blowin in flow rider
Inside of a low rider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk Im so biased to the hoes?
Listen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets
This isnt gob this is a blister in the salt
Those are your wounds this is the salt so get lost
Shit dissin me is just like pissin off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws
Ticklin him go to his grave skip him and visit his dog
Youre on fire
Thats how ya know your on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold
Your on fire
Man Im so fuckin sick I got ambulances pullin me over and shit
Youre on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
Youre on fire yeah youre on fire
I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook the for a song look
This aint a song its a warnin to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can stop writin and kill it
Im lightning in a skillet your a fuckin flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin a fan
Mr Mathers is the man
Yeah Im pissed but I would rather take this energy
And stash it in a can come back and whip your ass with it again
Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand itll eat through
Anything metal the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think
That you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine
Yeah ask the nine man hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon
Fuck it I aint playin pull up in a van and hop out
At a homeless man holdin a sign sayin
Vietnam vet Im out my fuckin mind man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him  grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This aint savage you aint never seen the brew
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldnt make a belemic puke
On a piece of fuckin corn and peanut boo
Sayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin at air
I aint even talkin to no one cause aint nobody there
Nobody will fuckin test me cause these hos wont even dare
Im wastin punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw dont waste it save it psycho yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michaels hair
Youre on fire

Man Im so hot my motherfuckin firetrucks on fire homie
Youre on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
Youre on fire yeah your on fire
Youre on fire
on fireRecovery.
As I fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil like I think Ill just have a taste
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like Yeah thats great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I havent ate
Maybe Ill grab a plate of nachos and Ill have a steak
And youd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy somethings is wrong with Dad I think
Hes acting weird again hes really beginning to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesnt hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car
Eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat
Sometimes I feel so alone
I just dont know feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold its like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I cant and I wont say I tried but I know thats a lie
Cause I dont and why I just dont know
Maybe just a nice cold brew whats a beer?
Thats the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me hes all I can fuckin hear
Marshall come on well watch the game
Its the Cowboys and Buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half
Ill be half buzzed for half of the time
Whos that mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine sound asinine
Yeah I know but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch Im about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cause I didnt feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man fuck am I hungover? And goddamn Ive got a headache
Shit half a Vicodin why cant I?
All systems ready for take off please stand by
Sometimes I feel so alone
I just dont know feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold its like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I cant and I wont say I tried but I know thats a lie
Cause I dont and why I just dont know
So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it aint even like Im gettin high
Now I need it just not to feel sick yeah Im gettin by
Wouldnt even be taking this shit if DeShaun didnt die
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use
Theres new rules its cool if its helpin you to get through
Its twelve noon aint no harm in self inducin a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax
And since Im convinced that Im insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see
Thats an Ambien each nap how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Okay so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years just to put out an album B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
It was bologna was it the methadone ya think?
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide aint it? So you can lie to Haley
 Im going beddy bye Whitney baby goodnight Elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor damn
Sometimes I feel so alone
I just dont know feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold its like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I cant and I wont say I tried but I know thats a lie
Cause I dont and why I just dont know
deja vuRelapse.

So lets get down to business
I dont got no time to play around what is this?

Intro
The Invasion! Invasion yeah
Green Lantern! the infiltration we comin! yeah
Bridge Eminem
I got  Cent I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch wit Obie Trice!
So watch what you say fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it wont be nice!
Verse Eminem
Whoa here we go I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obies coming
D-Tweezys coming youre sick to your stomach
 percent of its  cent
The other  percent of its whos color of skin it is
But if you even considerin taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I aint trying to get too intricate into it
Im just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then its gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then Im a flip then Im a get to
Stomping in my Air Force Ones
But you wont be able to tell 
If its two pairs or its one
Its just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
Youd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I dont know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Yall tickle me pink 
I think Id just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the Eminem vocal scratch
Wit a pinch of Biggie
Look at me Im just the bomb diggedy
Chorus Eminem

invasion the realestMiscellaneous feat. F.B.T. Eminem
And everyone should get along..
Okay children quiet down quiet down
Children Id like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian dont throw that Shut up!
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia Hes got aids!
Good luck Mr. Shady
Eminem
Hi there little boys and girls FUCK YOU!
Today were gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first Id like you to meet my friend Bob Huh?
Say hi Bob! Hi Bob Bobs  and still lives with his mom
And he dont got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
When its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks AHH!
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge
Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldnt even take him to Dres to get Bob a Dr.
He grabbed Stace by the legs as chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And thats the story of Bob and his marijuanaAnd what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any - its bad for you
Chorus ~Mr. Mackey~ Eminem
See children drugs are bad come on
And if you dont believe me ask ya dad ask him man
And if you dont believe him ask ya mom thats right
Shell tell you how she does em all the time she will
So kids say no to drugs thats right
So you dont act like everyone else does uh-huh
Then theres really nothin else to say sing along
Drugs are just bad okay?
Eminem
My penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it?
FUCK NO you aint seen it its the size of a peanut Huh?
Speakin of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you dont do it
Kids two hits will probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final you wont get it back
So dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach twenty-one years old
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
And decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper drive
And his eyes roll back in his skull
His back starts to - look like the McDonalds Arches
Hes on Donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
Hey Adam Zach is a jackass look at him!
Cause they took it too so they think its funny
So theyre laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile Zachs in a coma the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicin yoga
And thats the story of Zach the ecstasy maniac
So dont even feed that to squirrels class cause its bad for you
Repeat Chorus
Eminem
And last but not least one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it offBag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of em..
And sometimes you see things that arent there Like what?
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
Mr. Shady whats a G-string? Its yarn Claire
Women stick em up their behinds go out and wear em Huh?
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Ya tongue gets all swoll up like a cows tongue How come?
Cause it comes from a cows dung Gross!!
See drugs are bad its a common fact
But your mom and dad know thats all that Im good at Oh!
But dont be me cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
Theyre gonna come for me and Ima have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide cause itll be my fault
So dont do drugs and do exactly as I dontCause Im bad for you
Repeat Chorus
Mr. Mackey ~Eric Cartman~
Come on children clap along Shut up!
Sing along children Suck my motherfuckin dick!
Drugs are just bad drugs are just bad South Park is gonna sue me!
So dont do drugs Suck my motherfuckin penis!
So therell be more for me Hippie! God dammit!

I dont know man just feels like were a lot different
Kinda feels like were on a whole different page right now
It feels strange but um I guess its kind of like its kind of like
I feel like Im morphin into somethin
Thats so incredible that Im dwarfin
All competitors better get your girlfriend in check
Its psychological warfare endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect
Comes blastin out your deck she loves me
Such a passion youd expect this sort of reaction
From her yet
You strong arm youre fuckin corny
You try to turn your charm on
Cause you just think youre Bishop The Don Juan
But if you think that youre fuckin with me homie youre on one
Im cockin my head back like Ed Lover cmon on son
Shes on my Johnson she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like Shes fuckin with dude she wants some
Homeboy you better get a clue shes on my dick
Cause she I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack
When shes closin her eyes
Fantasizin her diggin her nails in my back to this track
Seduction seduce
Aint nobody whos as good at what I do
Its like a verbal seduction
Cause one minute she loves you the next she dont
Shes been stolen from you

Aint nobody whos as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you the next she dont
Shes been stolen from you

She says its quicker to count the things that aint wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
Theres a seven disc CD changer in her car
And Im in every single slot and youre not aw

And Im not about to sit back and just keep rhymin one syllable nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
Cause theyre just not good enough but Im not givin up
Til I get my respect and I wont stop til I get enough
Cause Im not livin up to my own expectations aw
That hater alarm is soundin off man
Obama took the bomb from my name aw
So quit cryin that I took your dame homie shes my dame aw
You sadly mistaken if youre thinkin that Im not on my game boy
And thangs just aint been that same since that day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard-on for me what you hollerin my name for?
Its your bitch on my dick aint my dang fault man I cant call it
Seduction seduce
Aint nobody whos as good at what I do

Homie youre losin her
Oh wait you dont like it when I spit it fast am I tryin to show out?
Let me slow it down some
Its still gonna be a blow out
Youre gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin to see
If you can save any of it punk but none of its fuckin with me
Prick you really feelin that bullshit
You think youre killin them syllables? Quit
Playin these beats aint nothin to fool with
They call me Fire Mashall I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
Youre a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awestruck
Shes love stricken shes got her jaw stuck
From suckin my dick aw fuck
Seduction seduce
Aint nobody whos as good at what I do
Its like a verbal seduction
Cause one minute she loves you the next she dont
Shes been stolen from you

And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently you just being hurt this aint gonna work

Cuz we are just gonna be enemies

Coming to terms where we can agree
There aint gonna be no reason speakin wit me
You speak on my seed then me no speakin Englais
So we gonna beef and keep on beefin unless
Youre gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face and youre gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that youve never seen
And youre gonna see this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D- and thanks but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely I dont need fifteen of my homies
When I see you Im seeing you me and you only
We never met but best believe you gon know me

Depicts fiction in his verse

b rabbit v s lotto nd battle from  mileMiscellaneousWarning this shits gon be rated R restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? Its self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma Bitch you got a sick kid
Arrested molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
Im Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
Murder murder Redrum
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated till my stress is elevated
How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?
Illiterate illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littleer
Smoke a blunt while Im titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Yall thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didnt Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon fit in her
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I lace tunes Im out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits dip shits
Doing whip pits passed out like Sanford snip pits
Wheres the weed I wanna tamper with it
Ima let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her cant forget it
Fuck it maybe Im a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what Im on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch what the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip theres a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mamas chapped lips
Slap hips support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
Im just joking is Dirty Dozens really dust smoking?
If all your shits missing than probably one of us broke in
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
My heads ringing like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
Im out the game put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like Oh this is good who sing this?
Slim Shady his tape is dope I love it
Its rugged but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
It was predicted by a medic
Id grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic but I dont think this headaches ever vanishing
Panicking I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen Manaquin posted stiffer than a statue
I think Im dying God is that you?
Somebody help me before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB they dont support no hip hop
They say thats where it ends the closest they gon come is Tupac
Its politics its all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Ha ha ha
We love you
How many people are proud to be
Citizens of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights of men
Who have died for the protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech
The United States Government has sworn to uphold
  Yo I want everyone to listen to the words of this song
Or so were told
I never would a dreamed in a million years Id see
So many mothafuckin people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
Its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me
So many lives I touched
So much anger aimed at no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays straight through your radio waves
It plays and plays till it stays stuck in your head
For days and days
Who would a thought standin in this mirror
Bleachin my hair wit some peroxide
Reachin for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the fore front of rap like this
How can I predict my words and have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office
Cuz Congress keeps tellin me
I aint causin nottin but problems
And now they sayin Im in trouble wit the government
Im lovin it
I shoveled shit all my life and now Im dumpin it on
White America
I could be one of your kids

Look at myselfLets do the math if I was black I woulda sold half
I aint have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
Im too cool to go back gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin studios at
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No lables wanted to sign me
Almost gave up I was like Fuck it
Until I met Dre the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got was probably his in exchange
For every white fan that hes got like damn we just swapped
Sittin back look at this shit wow
Im like My skin is it startin to work to my benefit now?
White America

  White America
Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL
Look how many hugs I get
See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
These moms probly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mothafuckin turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit me too cuz I looked like them
Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin wit a fine toothed comb
Its like this rope waitin to choke tightenin around my throat
Watchin me while I write this like
I dont like this no
All I hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely Hip Hop is never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers of daughters startin to blossom
Now Im catchin the flack from these activists
When they raggin
Actin like Im the first rapper to smack a bitch
And say faggot shit
Just look at me like Im ya closest pal
A poster child
The mothafuckin spokesman now

To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it
With a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms Cheeney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freeness of speech
This divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you

Skam
Man Im tired of bein tired everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks tired of bein late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin and endin up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers that aint shit with out make-up wake up
Gold diggin bitches the buck stops here 
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe aint fittin girl leave that shit alone
You aint Erykah Badu what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin like I dont care
My hair look like I aint come it shit a damn near year
So I burn zig-zag I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard so you dont land shit
Suck Skams dick off of what a dead man spit
Yo thats it I dont plan shit you know how we go down
They need to slow down and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party gettin so damn drunk
Cant remember the lass ass you kissed or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex in the street got me veck
Tryin to roll up on Miami leavin with a broke neck
Oh shit leathal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up white rappers like im throwin gas signs
And Im buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldnt mess with me fuckin shit up in the same room
Hey you I dont know you but fuck it let me get a dollar
For this bad car that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami the baby jammin like three up in the chamber 
Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?
Chorus
Verse  
Eminem
Some people say Im strange I tell them aint shit change
Im still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your pukus turnin to yellow with orange mukus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
Im not a rapper Im a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
Cause when I drop the science motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
Im just a mean person you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M- burstin
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin 
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally
Ill take it back before we do each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
Ill take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane to the night you were started 
Cock block your fathers game 
Ill plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when Im down with ten seconds left then to hope out
Ima throw a head-but so hard Ill knock us both out

Ill have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Jacking lifes of MCs now Im set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down Im steaming like a teapot
Ill make the tea hot people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle then I chase them in a Jason mask
Its an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemys appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when hes through with his verse Im all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldnt flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula

Inferior deterior rate like bacteria
Materially killing serially clearly youll see
How much in fear when u hear me youll be
Shiver and shake quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache whither and break
You slithering snake gibbering fake fibbering flake
Ill twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake for fisherman sake
If this is a dream youd wish you can wake
Every dis you can take personal
We aint friends trying to make amends
If you aint ever stole a gate you can take a fence
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases you bad diseases thats the reason
Im showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
Ive never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess

No wheels and no keys no boats no snowmobiles
And no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family
With groceries
Got a crib wit a studio and its all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did yall think Ima let my dough freeze? Ho please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-Es Ice Cubes and D.O.Cs
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said Mother fuck tha police
Gave you tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasnt doin too good
Whos the Doctor they told you to go see?
Yall better listen up closely
All you niggaz that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped

So what do you say to somebody you hate
What?
Or anyone tryin to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
Yup
Then just study a tape of N.W.A.
One day I was walkin by wit a Walkman on
When I caught a guy give me an awkward eye
What you lookin at?
And strangled him off in the parkin lot
Wit his Karl Kani
I dont give a fuck if its dark or not
Im harder than me tryin to park a Dodge
When Im drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin out wit two broken legs tryin to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch call the cops
Ima kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still werent found out
Right here
From here on out its the Chronic 
Startin today and tomorrows the new
And Im still loco enough
To choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew
Slim shady hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid s
Callin men ladies sorry Doc but I been crazy
Theres no way that you can save me
Its okay go with him Hailie
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say
But nothin comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
If it was up to me
You muhfuckers would stop comin up to me
Wit your hands out lookin up to me
Like you want somethin free
When my last CD was out you wasnt bumpin me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you wont get a crumb from me
Cause Im from the streets of
Compton
I told em all all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I aint got none
What you think I sold em all?
Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
Tryin to get this damn label off?
I aint havin that this is the millenium of Aftermath
It aint gon be nothin after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap! You can have it back
So wheres all the Madd Rappers at?
Its like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped wit gats
When you were cuddlin a Cabbage Patch
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say
But nothin comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish

Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly his conscience comes into play
Alright stop!

And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
But who are you?

Go in and gaffe the money and run to one of your aunts cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
Youll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renees razor blades
Yeah but if it all goes through like its supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and theyll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk shes older than George Burns
Fuck that! Do that shit shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

When they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
In confrontation aint no conversation if you feel youre in violation
Any hesitation will get you killed
If you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it
Bein reasonable will leave you full of bullets pull it
Squeeze it till its empty tempt me push me pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

They wont budge Ill never fall or fold up

I love pissin you off hits me off like my lawyers
When the fuckin judge lets me off
All you motherfuckas gotta do is set me off
Ill violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off
Im a lit fuse anything I do bring its news
Pistol whippin motherfuckin bouncers six-two who needs bullets?
Soon as I pull it you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
Its actually better cause instead of you murderin
You can hurt em and come back again and kick dirt at em
Its like pourin salt in the wounds assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin out their halter tops
Runnin and duckin out to the hot rocks parkin lot
Youll all get shot whether its your fault or not cuz

I spit it slow so these kids know that Im talkin to em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
Im like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it and look how I got you bitches rockin to it
You motherfuckas could never do it like I could do it
Dont even try it youll look stupid do not pursue it
Dont ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch
So ticky tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that Ill never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
Till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that adverse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity Im a

I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim but I wasnt
t tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs
Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldnt just see this shit myself its me
Nobody coulda seen this shitIfelt
Knowin damn well she wasnt gonna be there when I fell to catch me
The minute she was seen she just bailed
Im standin and swingin on like  people by myself
I couldnt even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold  million records I dont need to go to jail
Im not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down tryna get my feet on solid ground so for now

Bury my face in comic books cuz I dont wanna look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of tylonol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I prolly should cuz these problems are piled all at once
Cuz everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think Im bottoming out but Im not about to give up
I gotta get up thank God I got a little girl
Now Im a responsible father so not alotta good
Id be to my daughter layin in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood cuz I dont know how to do it
All I know is that I dont want her following in the footsteps
Of my dad cuz I hate him so bad
Worst feeling I had was growing up to be like his fuckin ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell em
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€ say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€
Say â€½Goodbyeâ€ say â€½Goodbye to Hollywoodâ€

I dont wanna quit this shit it feels like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick
Publicity my ass consume my fuckin dick
Fuck the guns Im done Ill never look at gats
If I scrap Ima scrap it like I never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamt Id get to the level that Im at
This is wack this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasnt never good at that
Its like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt Im trapped
If I could go back I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil Ill never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from bein no one and seein everything blow up
And all you did was grow up mceein
Its fuckin crazy all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had
Ive forced us to live alienated so Im sayin

All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan of citizen by stands
But shit is in my hands heres your life span
For what your lifes worth this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and live a nice land
See Im a nice man but money turned me to Satan
Im thirsty for this green so bad Im dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin
I want the whole plot I wont be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description an sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cuz I got a daughter to feed
And dollar  aint enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
An hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasnt nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin Freeze
But Im already wanted for sellin keys
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots they bust back
Hit the square in the chest he wasnt wearin a vest
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
Left the house pullin out the drive backin out
Need a backin out this ladys Jag started blackin out
Pulled the Mac- out stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin mouth before I blow the brain
From out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it mug her while youre there jacked her up
Stole her car made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on Set it off did
Jetted off kid stole the whip now Im a criminal
Drove in through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but Im injured badly though
Parents screamin Son go in and call the police
Tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
Tried to stall him atleast long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
Smashed the window grabbed the Nintendo 
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
And colliding with an -year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese eggs milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo
And I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up Im surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin Truce truce
Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasnt me it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state

When to Stand Up

No...you hear me! You go to hell -gt Mr. Garrison
Eminem
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Moms wouldnt take it the bitch still hates me
One day she said Go rake leaves I said Make me!
Im proud to announce i was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed Please fix me!
Back then when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta the fake school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me see if I dont live up to this image
Break shit!
scratched X
No...you hear me! You go to hell!
Parl Yams
Yo yall rappers have never learned
Thats why Im fuckin wit yall
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit Parl
I bring it to your high school smoke the prom
Put your brother in an air lock choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven 
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than James Evans
My left hands sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like Kool Keith
Fuck like you stole from me and rules the streets
I dont wanna have to fuck you up so cool cease
Parl Yams be the chosen thug
What i spit be cold juice like a fruitful hug
Run the streets while youre stuck at home
My temper life bushwick bill fucker leave me the fuck alone
Ive been jealous since niggas was windmillin
These cats just started to rhyme my pens spillin
And moms just told me to act ive been wheelin
So boy just slow your deck ive been stealin
I wet rappers cause its me and Em
I guess I just aint give a fuck like Eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like ? ? ? and bustin your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggaz what to suck
And my young lords when to stand up and light the Dutch
scratched X
No...you hear me! You go to hell!
Eminem
I ended my last show with a horse swingin a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I dont give a fuck you better understand that
Two Zantacs I give a fuck if I sound whack
Billboard drugs is what I kill for
Im Happy Gilmore you slip me anything in pill form
Im in to mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike Im  Thursday six more birthdays 
and Im blowin my brains out when Im thirty
As long as my heart beats Ima keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So Im the Rapper Hes the DJ
Im the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin FUCK
So Jeff give me a scratch scratched No!
Yall can kiss my ass until your lips stick to my pants

No...you hear me! You go to hell!

What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around
With my dear Veronica
Wait a minute you hold hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other
Love what do you know of love?
We were destined to be together I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No Roger thats not what I want to do
I love her and were going to be together

Yo yo yo yo yo this is
This is my motherfucking anthem hip hop
To hip hop music anthem
Cause Im gonna keep doing hip hop music
until the day that I die aight bitch
Yo Im into voodoo tarot cards and ugji boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle with a life full of drama like Tupacs
Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots
Landing in someones backyard getting chewed up by two rocks
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like new tops
I use to sell pizzas now i got twelve visas
So tell jesus Im gonna quit sending when hell freezes
chorus
Thats why my brain is out of order
Thats probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over
Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to partys bumping nasty nass new song
And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced aint it taste tainted
Your whole place fainted I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci-fi t.v
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while Im screaming while Im handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

Thats why my brain is out of order
Thats probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older

Fuck droppin the jewel Im flippin the sacred treasure 
Ill bite your motherfuckin style just to make it fresher 
I cant take the pressure Im sick of bitches 
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while Im washin dishes

Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush

Went to gym in eighth grade raped the womens swim team

mommyMiscellaneousYo I dedicate to this to yo
To all my fans keeping yall in health
Lets tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
Cause its cruel when you cause a bad heart conditioning
Which I create cause thats my mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay
I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you cause I get respect I pet you
Boy
Im even liked better by your niece and nephew
Cmon
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Pecker wood mad cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots found the redneck in his blood
And said Heck country western rap records are good
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He cant rap or sing but he wants to do both
Ha ha
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
Its the start of an era rock raps harder this year
No ones trying to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair
Sittin on stage strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your fuckin chest til your heart kicks in gear
Bitch
And fuck your underground buddys nameless crew
Like Ima say they names so they can be famous too
You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of house of pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
Ima kill you
Ima kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
Ima kill you
Ima kill you
Yo heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote your fuckin answer backs a joke
And Ima tell these motherfucking fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I aint notice you? Bitch I had a show to do!
Like Im supposed to be star-struck come over to you
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfucking DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap
Quicker but never last and Everlast is a
Aight listen so this is what we ask of our fans
Look
If you ever see Everlast whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks bricks rocks throw shit at him
Kick him spit on him treat him like a hoe bitch-slap him
Do it for me do it for Fred do it for limp
Do it for Rock do it for rap do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T do it just to do it fuck it
Hes a bitch he aint gon hit you back hes nothin
Shit in five years well all be eating at Whiteys
And hell be bussin tables in that bitch
Cleaning the toilets

You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy drop the mic lets fight
Plus I punch you in the chest weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford forty and white lethargic ass dickhead
I keep em coming while you running out of breath
Steady ducking while Im punching at your chest you need to rest
Dilated go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CDs nobody sees when they released
Evidence dont fuck around with real MCs
Who aint ready for no underground beef so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know its on for life
But Everlast might die tonight haha
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill you know!
Grab s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey I hit em up!
Hahaha yo check this out
You faggots aint even on my level
Ima let D- ride on you bitch-made ass faggots!
Yo! Get out the way yo get out the way yo
Whitey Fords heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back he had another heart attack
Whitey Fords getting his ass floored for talkin back
Little faggot Hamburgular I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt while Im servin ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart til it stops
Call the cops Ima beat your ass while they watch
Ha ha now we got the whole industry making fun of you Erik
Wheres your House of Pain now? Theres only one of you Erik
You a petty coward you aint ready to steady go a round
With some killers from  Mile to the motherfucking Belle Isle Bridge
Unverified
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This aint no freestyle battle everlast getting killed with his chest open
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch but you just chokin
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
Cause you suck motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin bout you packing pistols but its funny to me
You aint never been in trouble you just wanna be me
Im a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin prison pistol whipping tail ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay ha
Now its all about country you gave up Hip-Hop
Forty-nine thousand copies the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit em up!
Im from Detroits Pemberton Ave. where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music we got an Uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo dilated you violated
Now you bout to get annihilated we gon bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut
What the fuck? Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
And stuff him in cardboard chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts I stomped on his heart
D- Amityville fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
Cause we hit em up like motherfucking Tupac Shakur
You a Black Jesus heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonalds Big Mac greases
White devil washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

Cause Ima still be Madd Rapper whether I got money or not yup
As long as Im on pills and I got plenty of pot
Ill be in a canoe paddlin makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybodys pissin me offeven the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No shit Im a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?
Just pull the plug!
People say that Im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked Im just addin to it
They say Im suicidal teenagers newest idol cmon!
Cmon do as I do go ahead get mad and do it
Just pull the plug!
People say that Im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked Im just addin to it
They say Im suicidal teenagers newest idol cmon!
Cmon do as I do go ahead get mad and do it
Just let it gooo!
Im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
Im meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments Ow! Ow! Ow!
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And aint shit changed I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed th grade
You probably think that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it
I dont promote violence I just encourage it cmon
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps ahhhhhhhh!
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the windyou and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
Shit why not blow your brain out Im blowin mine out
Fuck it you only live once you might as well die now
Just pull the plug!
People say that Im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked Im just addin to it
They say Im suicidal teenagers newest idol cmon!
Cmon do as I do go ahead get mad and do it
Just pull the plug!
People say that Im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked Im just addin to it
They say Im suicidal teenagers newest idol cmon!
Cmon do as I do go ahead get mad and do it
Just let it gooo!
My laser disc gon make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin out
Your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
Im not a Role Model I dont wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl and Hailey Jade is Shadys business
And Shadys just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Gradys bitch got
I knew that Just the Two of Us would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us that aint got shit to do with us
And our personal life its just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch

Chorus Its a broke day but everything is ok Its ok
Im up all night but everything is alright Its alright
Its a rough week and I dont get enough sleep I cant sleep
Its a long year pretending I belong here Belong here
Its a broke day but everything is ok Its ok
Im up all night but everything is alright Its alright
Its a rough week and I dont get enough sleep I cant sleep
Its a long year pretending I belong here Belong here
Verse  Eminem
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till Im glad to be buried 
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause Im still struggling hard to be the man and its tough
Cause man its been rough but still I manage enough
Ive been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I dont panic and huff frantic and puff
Or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
Im anteing up double or nothing Ive been trouble enough
And Im sick of struggling and suffering see
My destinys to rest at ease till Im impressed and pleased
With my progress I wont settle for less than cheese
Im on a quest to seize all my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
Im too stable to fall the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf Q

Verse  Eminem
Im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep 
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
Ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a mans actions
But in the mist of this insanity I found my Christianity 
Through God and theres a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
Trying to wrestle I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brothers trying to learn his mathematics
Hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
Im using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
Its cumbersome Im trying to do well on this Earth
But its been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

Jealous! X
Girls voice Talking over the singing
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous know what Im saying?
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes know what Im saying?
Girls dont buy him no clothes He bought that ho some clothes!!
He dont buy me no clothes Nigga aint got no money no vibe no dick
I mean What do I got to be jealous for?
He aint gonna make it no where he aint got no type of time
He has no career move I mean...
Verse 
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say Im bad at timing things
So whats a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch that aint what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So Ima wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See Ive never been so sure and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck Im in I need my second wind Say What?

Jealous of me know what Im saying? Thats what Im talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy
Verse 
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense theres someone else you like 
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like sampled I need a new nigga 
Someone rich that I could follow
And youll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now Im on my feet again
And so we meet again your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life I got a message from Phife
He goes You didnt want me to see you then I dont want you now
Take a towel wipe your brow quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house yall Fellas sing it...

jealousy woes iiInfiniteHey listen
I love my job it makes me feel like Superman
Can you fly? I can
Wanna see?
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really shouldve fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark theres a ray theres a light
Theres a hope theres a spark
But when planets collide theyll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead and feel the vibe because
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
Its stupid aint it? I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot pointy nosed bleached blond
Cuz I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin constantly using
The constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
Ill be here when yall are gone re building
World revolving still evolving still Slim
How many kids will copy ? Probably millions
But Ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin rate common denominate
Add it up and youll see thats why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make Slim youre great
But wait cant you see Im only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cuz man I see it feel it live it
But its inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you aint
But they dont understand that Ive been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you cant just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And its such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you

Rap Superstar
Eminem Speaking
Most people dont see how much work is really involved 
in this rap shit
I didnt know it
I didnt see it
I never saw it until i was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta 
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what im sayin
No matter what u just been through
B-Real
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large a big house 
 cars youre in charge
Comin up in the world 
Dont trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
B-Real
I remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
Lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you dont know about the blood sweat and tears 
and losin some of your peers
And losin some of your self 
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you dont manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Dont know how to act
Shits deep
 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will 
Till he crosses over still
Feelin no hate 
But fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who dont know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high
And some cant pay to play
Trapped in what you rappin about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing 
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name
Chorus
So you wanna be a rap superstar 
And live large
A big house 
 cars 
The rent charged
Comin up in the world dont trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house 
 cars 
The rent charged
Comin up in the world dont trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
Noreaga Speaking
When you sign to a record label
You dont know you sign your life over
And these whiteboys dont care about you
Cuz the minute you fall off
Theyll find another Noreaga
And theyll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And theyll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep 
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And mafuckin get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And the drug game is even worse
Because if someone jerks you 
You can shoot em and kill me
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble
Eminem Speaking
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what im sayin give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it aint shit
Chorus
B-Real
My own son dont know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonley
But I thank god Im wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by sony
Im in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar 
Wit no shame give him a year
And theyll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This aint easy take it from weezy 
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil

Wasting My Time
by Bookmat
I dont think you understand
That what youre doing is not so cool
You think its funny to mess with my mind
Dont you
You know I like you so you just tease me
You give me just enough to hang on enough
When youre just wasting my time
Youre simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time
Do you hear me when I say
So let me ask you something
Do you think Im pretty or dont you
Do you wanna get with me or not and nowwww
Or are you just wasting my time
Youre simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time
And what would youve got to say
Well things have got to change
Say this just isnt right
I dont wanna have to fight
And I think Id better go
Cause this aint working out any more
and Im sorry sorry sorry
Understand
That what you did
Was just not so cool
Baby youre just not that cool

Intro Slim Shady
May I have your attention please 
May I have your attention please 
Will the Real Slim Shady please stand up? 
I repeat will the Real Slim Shady please stand up? 
Were gonna have a problem here... 
verse  
Yall act like you never seen a white person before 
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door 
Started whoopin her ass worst than before

Its the return of the 
Awww wait no way your kidding 
He didnt just say what I think he did did he? 
And Dr Dre said... 
Nothing you idiots Dr Dres dead hes locked in my basement haha 
Feminist women loved Eminem 
Chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady Im sick of him 
Look at him walking around grabing his you-know-what 
Flippin the you-know-who yea but hes so cute though 
Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose 
But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms 
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and let Loose 
but cant but its cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose 
My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips 
And if im lucky u might just give it a little kiss 
And thats the messege we deliver to little kids 
and expect them not to know what a womens vagina is 
Of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is 
by the time they hit th grade 
they got the discovery channel dont they? 
We aint nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals 
who rip other people open like canolopes 
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes 
then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope ughh 
But if you feel like I feel I got the antadoite 
Women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus 
And it gooooesss 
Refrain 
Im Slim Shady 
Yes Im the Real Shady 
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So wont the real Slim Shady... 
Please stand up Please stand up Please stand up 
Cause Im Slim Shady 
Yes Im the Real Shady 
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating 
So wont the real Slim Shady... 
Please stand up Please stand up Please stand up 
verse  
Will Smith dont gotta cuss in his raps to sell records 
Well I do so f--- him and f--- you too 
You think I give a damn about a grammy? 
Half of you critics cant even stomach me let alone stand me 
but Slim what if u win wouldnt it be weird? 
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here? 
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears 
s--- Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs 
So I can sit next to Carson Daily and Fred Durst 
And hear them argue over who she gave head to first 
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV 
yea hes cute but I think hes married to Kim hehe 
I should download a audio on mp 
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem head scream 
Im sick of you little golden boy groups all you do is annoy me 
So I been sent in here to destroy you 
And theres a million of us just like me 
Who cuss like me 
Who just dont give a f--- like me 
Who dress like me 
Walk Talk and act like me 
It just might be the next best thing 
But not quite me 
Refrain 
verse  
Im like a headtrip to listen to 
Cause Im only giving you 
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room 
The only difference is I got the balls to say it In front of yall 
And I dont got to be false or sugar coat it at all 
I just get on the mic and spit it 
Wheather you like to admit it 
Im better than % of you rappers out there 
Then you wanna outkin kids like these albums like 
Its funny cuz the rate im going when Im  
Ill be the only person in the nursing home flirting 
Pinching nurses asses when Im hard jerkin Im jerking 
But this whole bag of viagra isnt working 
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin 
He could be workin at Burger King spitten on your onion rings 
Were in the parking lot circling

With his windows down and system up 
So will the Real Shady please stand up 
and put one of those fingers on each hand up 
and to be proud to out of your mind and out of control 
and one more time loud as you can how does it go? 
Ha ha
Guess theres a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it lets all stand up
intro slim shadyMiscellaneousAttention all units attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat we have an APB on a man with green hair
Hes armed with a knife I repeat hes armed with a knife
Proceed with caution watch your back fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next
Theres a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
Hell stab you with a sword dont be fooled by his charm
Hes probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm look for a man with green hair
Check at your girls house he was last seen there
Hes has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
I make you think youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think
Youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Stay away from him he aint no good
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that hes wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
I make you think youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think
Youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Stay away from him he aint no good
Im on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me its sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
Im mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
Give me your girlfriend or Im gonna kill ya
I make you think youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think
Youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Stay away from him he aint no good
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where Im at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
I make you think youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think
Youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Stay away from him he aint no good
Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned
Theyre only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
Attention all cars attention all cars
Unit  has apprehended the suspect
Hes going back to the crazy home I repeat
Hes going back to the crazy home how about that?
I make you think youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think
Youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Stay away from him he aint no good
I make you think youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think
Youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Stay away from him he aint no good
I make you think youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think
Youre a best friend then why I oughtta
Stay away from him he aint no good

So fast itll look like an invisible man standin
Im headed for Hell Id rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton hit this and you better inhale
Here
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin takin advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Leave me alone!
Came home in a frenzy pushin a ten speed
Screamin to Aunt Peg
Aunt Peg
With three spokes stickin out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache give me a migraine
Dammit I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic aint
You rap knowin you wack
You act up and Im throwin you down a flight of steps
Then Im throwin you back up em
If they dont like the track fuck em
The rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
Ding ding!
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
Hurry up man
Im sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie
Im free-fallin feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest til you cant breathe
And when Im down to my last breath
Ima climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
And still have half left
Yall want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin directin and starrin in it
Yall want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin directin and starrin in it
Bad the bad

The evil
Take the evil with the evil
Put em together

Two times Slim Shady Royce the Five Nine
scary moviesMiscellaneousIm not afraid...Yeah...Im not afraid
To take a stand...Its been a ride...To take a stand
Everybody...I guess I had to...Everybody
Come take my hand...Go to the that place-...Come take my hand
Come take my hand...-to get this one...Come take my hand
Well walk this road together...Now some of you...Through the storm
Whatever weather...Might still be in that place...Cold or warm
Just let you know...Youre trying to get out...Youre not alone
Just Follow me...Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road...Ill get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em
But you wont take this thing out these words before I say em
Cause aint no way Im let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say em or do something I do it I dont give a damn
What you think Im doing this for me so fuck the world
Feed it beans its gassed up if a things stopping me
Imma be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me Im tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album hes still shit
Whether hes on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first for better or worse
Hes married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
His gift is a curse forget the earth hes got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe
Im not afraid Im not afraid
To take a stand To take a stand
Everybody Everybody
Come take my hand Come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just let you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road
Ok quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shouldnt have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know its a rap
You said you was king you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings instead of getting crowned youre getting capped
And to the fans Ill never let you down again Im back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact
Lets be honest that last Relapse CD was ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax I aint going back to that now
All Im tryna say is get back click-clack BLAOW POW
Cause I aint playin around
Theres a game called circle and I dont know how
Im way too up to back down
But I think Im still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But its time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
Im not afraid Im not afraid
To take a stand To take a stand
Everybody Everybody
Come take my hand Come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just let you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road same road
And I just cant keep living this way
So starting today Im breaking out of this cage... age
Im standing up Imma face my demons
Im manning up Imma hold my ground
Ive had enough now Im so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now now... nowww
It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And dont even realise what you did believe me you
I been through the ringer but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
My world haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more beef flingers no more drama from now on I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibilitys as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldnt lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause Im raising the bar I shoot for the moon
But Im too busy gazing at stars I feel amazed and
Im not afraid Im not afraid
To take a stand To take a stand
Everybody Everybody
Come take my hand Come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just let you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road same road

And when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Till I collapse Im spilling these raps long as you feel em
til the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killing em
Cause when I am not then Imma stop penning em
And I am not Hip-Hop and Im just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when Imma stop sending em?
Women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillins just not real enough
The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Youre coming with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up
You bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck!

Music is like magic theres a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when its at its end
Because Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list heres the order of my list that its in
It goes Reggie Jay-Z Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me
But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy
So when Im not put on this list the shit does not offend me
Thats why you see me walking round like nothings bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The presss wet dream like Bobby and Whitney Nate hit me

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
Ill probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
Thats why Im clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
But I dont want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack Im launching at em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if Im not the baddest so
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out

I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have Ive been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid thats behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin
Tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin
Leavin with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but them never figure me out
Look at me now I betcha probably sick of me now
Aint you mama? I ma make you look so ridiculous now
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet - One more time
I said Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet - Ha!
I got some skeletons in my closet and I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it Ima expose it
Ill take you back to 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I dont owe him a second thought I just fuckin wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leavin her sideEven if I hated Kim Id grit my teeth and Id try
To make it work with her at least for Hailies sake I maybe made some mistakes
But Im only human but Im man enough to face em today
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause Id have killed em shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
Its my life Id like to welcome yall to the Eminem show
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet - One more time
I said Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessin your mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin
Goin through public housin systems victim of Munchhausens Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt
Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach doesnt it?
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me MA?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me MA?
But guess what ya gettin older now and its cold when yer lonely
And Nathans growin up so quick hes going to know that yer phony
And Hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song keep tellin yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didnt help me to getYou selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be!
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet - One more time
I said Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet

Oh god Sadams got his own Laden
With his own private plane his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges peach pears plums syringes

Hip hop is in a state of nine-one-one so.

Its just like old times the dynamic duo
Two old friends why panic? You already know
Whos is fully capable the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center --
You can even call collect the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career russian roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MCs dont see me
Believe me BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave dawg fo sheezy
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me
Til we grow beards get weird and disappear
Into the mountains nothing but clowns down here
But we aint fucking around round here
Yo Dre! what up? Can I get a hell? Hell Yeah!
Lets get down to business

Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
Look at me now I betcha prolly sick of me now
Aint you mama Ima make you look so ridiculous now
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
One More Time
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
Ha!
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Ima expose it Ill take you back to 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I dont on second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailey and I couldnt picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim I grin my teeth and I try to make it work
With her atleast for Hailies sake I maybe made some mistakes
But Im only human but Im man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause Id of killed em shit I wouldve shot Kim and him both
Its my life Id like to welcome yall to the Eminem show
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
One More Time
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
Ha!
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someones always going through her purse when shits missing
Going through public housing systems victim of munchhausen syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt
Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it?
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me ma?
But guess what your getting older now and its cold when your lonely
And Nathans growing up so quick hes gonna know that your phoney
And Hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral hahaha
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song keep telling yourself that you was a mum
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
You selfish bitch I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
One More Time
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
Ha!

Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Two pills I pop til my pupils swell up like two pennies
Im Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats cant chew through his last pants
Im like a mummy at night fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
Im like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds hurtin
Bitch its too late
Cause once youre hung from the drapes its curtains
Im an instigator  slug penetrator
Degradin creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin blood on my gators
My weedll hit yo chest like a double barrel gauge an
Im a black grenade thatll blow up in yo face
With a fifth in me when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say forgive me
Im snatchin every penny it gotta be that way nigga face it
That weed I sold to you brigade laced it
You hidin I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted

Your life is ruined you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon fight
So you can suck my dick if you dont like my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Cause I dont give a fuck if you dont like my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Plates expired soon as Im hired Im fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
Hey is Bizarre performing?

All bitches is hoes even my stinkin ass mom
Aiyyo flashback two feets two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin get your ass capped
The Kuniva divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin pockets ascap
I dont need a platinum chain bitch I snatch Shaqs
Born loser half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag
We stranglin rappers until the point they cant yell
Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adams apple until it crackle
Run right past you turn around grab you and stab you
Get executed cuz Im a luni
I got a yuk mouth and its polluted I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo Im doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin run up in church
And smack the preacher while hes preachin
Take a swing at the deacon
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight til I got caught sellin em shake
Im ignorant with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendents daughter my brains out of order
Ive been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer get dropped take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some ones
Til I met your fat mama now Im rollin in dough

under the influence liveOff the WallWho came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world
So come and kill me while my names hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot
Think Ive got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot
Stop they blood flow til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy I told you that I cant stop
Gotta make em fear you before you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I’ma come and kill you
I got mushrooms I got acid I got tabs and aspirin tablets
Im your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me Im your friend when you need a mini thin Slim Shady
Im Shady
I like happy things Im really calm and peaceful
I like birds bees I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out took a see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I dont want to just die a normal death I wanna be killed twice
How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When theyre high off of drugs they havent even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife she ever saw in her life
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
Cause Im the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think Ill write my biggest fan a Fuck you letter
I got mushrooms I got acid I got tabs and aspirin tablets
Im your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me Im your friend when you need a mini thin Slim Shady
Im Shady
Yo I listen to your demo tape and act like I dont like it
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
People dont buy shit no more they just dub it
Thats why Im still broke and had the number one club hit
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it Ive got herpes while were on the subject
And if I told you I had AIDS yall would play it
Cause you stupid motherfuckers think Im playin when I say it
I do take pills dont do speed
Dont do crack dont do coke I do smoke weed
Dont do smack I do do shrooms
Do drink beer I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mamas not dead shes still alive and bitchin
And I dont have herpes my dicks just itchin
Its not syphilis and as for bein AIDS infested
I dont know yet Im too scared to get tested
I got mushrooms I got acid I got tabs and aspirin tablets

Flipin the you know who yeah but hes so cute though
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let looseBut cant but its cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
By bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
And if Im lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And thats the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a womens clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit th grade
They got the discovery channel dont they
We aint nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote
Women wave your panty hoes sing the and it goes

And whether you like to admit it rip

Then you wonder how can kidz eat up these albums like valiums
Its funny cuz at the rate im going when Im

Pinching nurses asses when Im jackin off with Jergens and Im jerking
But this whole bag of viagra isnt working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling
Screaming I dont give a fuck
With his windows down and system up

He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do
I aint that mad though I just dont like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if Id write you
You would write back - see Im just like you in a way

He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day I drift away and put em on
cause I dont really got shit else so that shit helps when Im depressed

Well gotta go Im almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot howm I supposed to send this shit out
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itll all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriends pregnant now how far along is she
Look Im really flattered you would call your daughter that
And heres an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
Im sorry I didnt see you at the show I musta missed you
Dont think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But whats this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clownin doggCmon - how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And whats this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shitll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself I think that youll be doin just fine
If you relax a little Im glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just dont want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to
Come to think about his name was. it was you
Damn

You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz Im back Im on the rag and ovulating

Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prison is helpless
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary vision is scary could start a revolution
Pollutin the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And its a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well Im back fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then Im gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter

Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing Attention Please

Heres my  cents my  cents is free
A nuisance who sent you sent for me

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean Im disgusting
But its just me Im just obscene
Though Im not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy Hey
Theres a concept that works
 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
Itll be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy
Cuz it feels so empty without me

LOSE YOURSELF - 
 Week at  -  Weeks on chart
Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip
Yo
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now
The clocks run out times up over blah
Snap back to reality Oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked
Hes so mad but he wont give up that easy No
He wont have it he knows his whole back citys ropes
It dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke
Hes so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
Youd better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it youd better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
Youd better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it youd better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
The souls escapin thru this hole that its gapin
This world is mine for the takin
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is borin but superstardoms close to post mortal
It only grows harder only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows hes know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows
Hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
His homes dont want him no mo hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old potna but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da la la
Youd better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it youd better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
Youd better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it youd better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
No more games Ima change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like  dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I cant get by with my  to 
And I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed plus
See dishonour caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail
Ive got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin option failures not
Mom I love you but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got
Youd better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it youd better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
Youd better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it youd better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow

LIKE TOY SOLDIERS - 
 Week at 
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart
We never win
But the battle rages on for toy soldiers
Im suppose to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I aint never suppose to show it my crew aint suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino it dont matter
I never drag em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
Im suppose to set an example I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide em
If some shit ever just pop off Im suppose to be beside em
That Ja shit I tried to squashed it it was too late to stop it
Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
Im so caught it I almost feel like Im the one who caused it
This aint what Im in hip-hop for its not why I got in it
Now its never my object to for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build
It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And thats just outta respect for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out just wasnt my beef So I did
I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth while hes all over TV
Now Im talking a man who literally saved my live like fuck it
I understand this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart We never win
But the battle rages on for toy soldiers
It used to be time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dying
But now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
Shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it
Its a different ball game call names and you aint just rapping
We actually tried to stop the  and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
Until Ja start gabbing in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it  smash him mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulleyd in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motha fucker can get it too fuck em then
But Im so busy being pissed off I dont stop to think
That we just inherited s beef with murder inc
And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
Still have soldiers that is on the front line thats willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout em out in a rap or up in to show we love em back
And to let em know how important is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in
our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I aint trying to have none of me people hurt or murdered
It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
Ill walk away from it all before Ill let it go any further
Now dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im copping
Im just willing to be the bigger man
If yall can quiet popping off at the jaws with the knocking
Cause frankly Im sick of talking
Im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscious
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart We never win
But the battle rages on for toy soldiers

Yeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now.
But hey what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier stiffen up that upper lip.
What you crying about?
You got me.
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When Im gone but Im trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry
Cause youre scared I aint there? Daddys with you in your prayers
No more crying wipe them tears daddys here no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it we gon do it
Laney uncles crazy aint he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Were all we got in this world When it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze I know its confusin you
Daddys always on the move mammas always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I dont see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby dont you cry everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why we fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby but I promise mommas gon be alright
Its funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree
And said some of em were from me cause daddy couldnt buy em
Ill never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom
Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
And thats when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And momma didnt like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now Im sittin in this empty houseJust reminiscing lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
Wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
Laney Im talkin to you too daddys still here
I like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it?
Shh mommas only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise mommas gon be alright
And if you ask me too daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
Imma give you the world
Imma buy a diamond ring for you imma sing for you
Ill do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
Imma break that birdies neck
Id go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat dont fuck with dad ha ha
mockingbird clean versionMockingbirdYeah
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
But heyWhat daddy always tell you?

And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now Im sitting in this empty house just reminiscing
Lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
Wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
Laney Im talkin to you too daddys still here
I like the sound of that yeah
Its got a ring to it dont it?
Shh mommas only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen
mockingbird instrumentalMockingbirdMusic reality sometimes its hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Sike!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
Im see-saw battling
But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake
Theres too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smoking crack?
Before I do that I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up for I get down run myself in the ground for I put some wack shit out
Im trying-a smack this one out the park five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark
Aint gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass just twist me off
See me leap out pull the piece out fuck shooting Im just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now bitch lets see you freestyle
Talk is cheap motherfucker if youre really feeling froggish leap
Youre slim youre gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you you cant let him scape with that
Man I hate this crap this aint rapThis is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There aint no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you wouldve tried
The only way Im leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically arrived back at my enemys crib with HennesseyGot drunk then I finished he
Im every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently
Im not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I cant stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man son of Sam bitch Im surgical
Ill allergic to dying you think not? you got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at firstThought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worstIt hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you aint got nothing left but your word and your balls
And youre stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it aint thats the end no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till you car spin you then
Damn!
U slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funerals tomorrow wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Lets see how many of your men loyalWhen I pull up looking for youWith a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
Im revved up who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff Im hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward bullets devour you showered you
Niggas if I was you niggas Ill run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself it cant hurt me just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me you aint worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life fuck the tour and the mic
Ill rather fuck a whore with a knife deliver that shit the coroners like
You high hype poppin shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night
When The Music Stops
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors
You all dont want war you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga Im a wolf get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach the more I moves
This hill street this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels nigga
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop you better drop when the music stop
Musics changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
NWA said fuck the police
Now Im in jail
 was strictly RampB
Fucked up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson who gonna tell me I aint Mike
Ass cheeks painted white
Fucking Presilla at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
MOP had me grindy and griddy
Marilyn Manson I dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bowls
Now Im in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow

put it on my wee weeGreen LanternIma go if it .but i know what i know what youre thinking
. the greatest of all time
And i consider myself one of those
Thank you very much here it goes
This is the part i was worried about
Everyone said my career was down they .
and everyones telling me what i should do it .what its rap about
and i know i gotta lot of . look out that i get out
im not sure how this is gonna come on ...
the story got me giving a fuck what you really think about me
and you dont really know a thing about me
everyones is making a think about me
.some kind of . the king of .and surround with other gangstas
This killer .this criminal .is feel like im about to .
and i do my own mother fucker neighbor
the best all i need but thats why it seem like .this better than Jc
.and consider me one of the greatest my rappers a .
No one got .the best .
Ima go if it .but i know what i know what youre thinking
.consider me years ago ...
greatest of all timeGreen LanternIm a little nutty and I know it
but if you go back and
take a look at my history
you will see that Im
not the only one whos off his rocker
there were many before me
I was always labelled
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed I
grow to be but if you take a look
at us now youll see the apple didnt fall too far from the tree
haha alright look
Ima tell you the story
from my side maybe youll understand check it out
you done witnessed
unexplainable shit
too insane to explain
people run from what
the just dont get
maybe Shady shoulda
just hit em with a little bit
did I spit too soon?
Should I of spoon fed em it?
but I was just so eager
to prove I was even worth
being in the same
league or the room with of the people
of whom I was in every now and then I
look up like I was seeking approval
was it because of the
pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of
my imagination
maybe it bothered me
more than it did them
maybe it wasnt a big
deal back then
but to me it was see
what it was was
I had developed the
complex from being judged
Proof spit his versenow Im next lets see who
Im in the booth
staring back to see whos mugs
I get a reaction fromusually the first thumb was from
Proof
and the rest of the
group backed him up
and no one lied to
each other cause none of us had deals
it was real we just
wanted tickets for that meal
Sometimes I feel like
its just me
sometimes I feel like
Im going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple dont
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
its just me
sometimes I feel like
Im going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple dont
fall too far from the tree
Ever since my mother
was pregnant
with her second egg
cause she said
that I had a baby sister
who fell out of the window
I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects
I was like   and how come
I remember MalcolmIsaac and Boogie
if it was the projects in Missouri?
cause thosere my best
friends until Isaac
took my tricycle and
my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up getting
jumped and cut in the gut with a
switch and -some stitches
which is still to this day
why my mother still
tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious little
sister who never existed and this is why part of
my lifes so twisted
but I can never be as
sick as that bitch is
and by the way that
pictures one of my relatives
Sometimes I feel like
its just me
sometimes I feel like
Im going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple dont
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
its just me
sometimes I feel like
Im going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple dont
fall too far from the tree
You probably have to
peel back layers upon layers of
pain to see why everything
I say is so insane
whats different about my brain that separates me
from other players in this game? on the surface it may
seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
for me to get some damn sympathy
but thats the last thing
I need is for people
to walk around feeling
sorry for me me
and Im not a G never
claimed to be
I gave my vest to
Cashishell need it more than me
but well see cause we aint lookin for beef
but if it comes our
way what do we turn the other
cheek? come on
Sometimes I feel like
its just me
sometimes I feel like
Im going crazy
but take a look at my family
cause the apple dont
fall too far from the tree
I said ...
sometimes I feel like
its just me
sometimes I feel like
Im going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple dont
fall too far from the tree
appleGreen LanternIf I woulda rap about the crap thats out
Thats the route you probably want me to take
Cause youre just dyin to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say something about Paul Wall youd probably crap in your
Pants cause Im white and hes white so hes like
My competition I mean right?
Nope Paul Wall is dope
And sos Bubba so BLALALALAPFFTTTTT
B-b-b-b-b-but I dont compete with nobody
I just go hard do the rope-a-dope Ali
Shuffle and dance around my opponents do donuts
Sometimes I just play possom Like Im asleep thats awesome
Im like a sleeping Giant and when I awake Im like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite Prey
Sink my teeth in him and fill him full of poison
And make a noise like snake before I kill him
And let him know that I just dont feel him
And smack him with the backward E the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why look them dead in the eye then waste em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
And the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Their souls for this rap game and it g-g-goes
   that aint the hook now follow me
Theres nothing else for me to say my public adores me
Everybody bores me theyre just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers Come nearer

Im a goat
and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much here it goes!
This is the part I was worried about
everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
and Im in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
and everyones telling me what I should do
and how I should come out and what to rap about
and I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
and Im not sure how this is gonna come off
theyre probably gonna think that Im coming off as cocky haha
like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
see the thing about me
is you dont really know a thing about me
everyones making a stink about me
like theres some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers
and the most dangerous criminals
and I feel like Im more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin neighbors
but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
but why does it seem like Im not even put up in the same category as other emcees?
so when Weezy says that hes better than Jay-z
please be that just subliminally
means he thinks Jiggas the best and that hes
the only one up in that league see
and its easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
knowing god damn well that Im one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period.
Im a goat
and I dont mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazinesll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much here it goes!
Maybe they figure that Im on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
or a new Shady if they think its gonna happen
man I thought I was crazy
or maybe I could be takin it wrong and theyre tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Walls white
cause lyrically he doesnt pose a threat to anyone see hes just aight
and Bubba Sparxxx he just wont write
because hes so caught up in that snow white
that Timbaland cant even get him in the studio
hes so gone off that coke right
and its so sad cause hes dope right
Americas next great white hope right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show right
and which Im still havin mixed feelings about
they said itd be real Im just spillin it out
theres somethin about a white boy talking black and runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth
and I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
Isnt it ironic that the best rappers white and the best golfers black?
and Im the one whos gotta catch all the flack offa that
but these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until  Mile had came out
but I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin me now
when suddenly I wasnt such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me mustve died
thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
and anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
and Angelina Jolie is just another ho
and Brad is a sucka because once I fuck her
she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
you know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you want a Shady? Well you got it man
I aint apologizin for shit.
Im a goat
and I dont mean to gloat
but I know what I know and I know what you think
and these magazinesll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and I consider myself one of those
so thank you very much here it goes!
Man Im takin my ball and goin home man
shit is too easy
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
Im a goat
so dont worry Im out the motherfuckin game
and yall can sit and argue about whos the motherfuckin best
but yall know that
Im a goat
and like I said Im one of the motherfuckin best
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin bunch
but before I go Id like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasnt there from the start
and thank you very much to everybody who was
and yall aint gotta say it just think it

Grabbed a pen and pad and startin to jot somethin
Always told myself that I would never be losin
Man I aint had no hood my mother was always movin damn!
From Detroit to Texas Texas to Detroit
Goddamn mama whats the point?
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck with my step dad
When I was  years old I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older metaphors got stronger
And me my rap partner wasnt seein eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is Hip Hop Hip man I wont stop
Yo Big Boi what up? gimme a beat box

From the Hip Hop Shop to Maurice Malone

 Mile off Runyon where a star was born
United we stand divided we swore
And hell yeah I lived in my car
Bitch I was homeless I would have slept in a jar
And Dirty Management I wish yall the best
But me and my niggas we had to do whats best
To lose the mess
All the taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce we couldnt buy a ounce
And now that we platinum they diss our name
Like we wont go to the car and get them thangs
And beef sometimes you dont have a choice
To the fight with Whitey Ford to the beef with Royce
To the Ja Rules Benzinos and the niggas in the club
To the E-Dubs and niggas that you aint heard of
And man I dont know how to use a gun
But Ill learn quick if the fuckin beef come

Eminem
Man I thought this was supposed to be hip hop hip hop
Id rather be fishin in flip flops flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock did I
cant see no country singers beefin over some guitar riff
That Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger
When I was younger I was so eager to have a gun
I would do the same I couldnt wait to get to the shooting range
Me and my man goofy Gary would just try to let off some steaaaammmmm
Motherfuckers laughin cause I couldnt aim
So I pulled the fuckin target closer and just shoot the thang
I used to have this theory keep  bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no CCW license
I tried to apply for one they said itd take - months
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now back to what my  bullet theory was
Im triple platinum I aint tryna catch no murder one
Figured Id shoot to wound probably miss with at least one
But them other two gon fuck his shoulder and his knee cap up
Them Ima say self defense how come I had the gun
Was because I was at the range on the way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I get a year from each bullet at the most as opposed to havin a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic it was basically for safety
But it gave me power and it made me crazy
And psychotic I just got retarded once I got up and gotta
It was empty the night I got caught with it
What the fuck man I thought this was supposed to be...

hip hopPre UpLook if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted. In one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombsBut he keeps on forgetting what he wrote downThe whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over blaow!
Snap back to reality Oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked
Hes so mad but he wont give up that
Easy no
He wont have it he knows his whole backs to these ropes
It dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke
Hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
The souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms close to post mortem
It only grows harder homie grows hotter
He blows. Its all over. These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows
Hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes dont want him no more hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da da da
No more games Im a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebodys paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my  to 
And I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna
Baby mama dramas screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotonys gotten me
To the point Im like a snail
Ive got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go its my shot.
Feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You can do anything you set your mind to man

Some people ask me where I? ve been lately
They thought I fell off nobody could save me
I play in the background I don? t back down
So don? t get it twisted tryna play me
First I come out they underate me
Then I come back still try to fade me
They say I? m nasty say I? m crazy
Ask what I think I say maybe
I fly away
It ain? t nothin? in my way so I may aswell fly away
It ain? t nothin? else to say so I may aswell fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today
Cos I? ve been to the top and there? s nowhere else to go
The only way to see me is if you lookin? up from down below
And there? s nothin? else to say so I may aswell fly away
And there? s nothin? in my way so I may aswell fly away
I? m on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away
Eminem - Verse 
Got my self esteem back got my confidence up
I? ma step up on the stage now I? m gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt
And you aint gotta tell me notin? boy get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money two for the show
My shit don? t stink I dont think so
Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll
Are you ready now here we go
The bald eagle has landed
I? m back in ya hair sorry for leavin? you stranded

They cant sit I don? t think anybody understands it
Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands its playdough

Car crash shows what they know
Shit if I did it? d be a trailer not a car
The white trash star

Homie you got it backwards your dippin your soup inside ya crackers
I can carry rap til my back hurts
Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors
Get my back right
Now I? m right back on you bastards
I was chasin? the dragon I dont know what happened
It was like the feelin? I had when I first started rappin?
I just could? nt seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab thats where I? ve been at when?
Just Blaze - Chorus
Some people ask me where I? ve been lately

And expect them not to know what a womens clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit th gradeThey got the discovery channel dont they?
We aint nothing but mammalsWell some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes

My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy Im the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold diggers succubus my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic Im like a dyke cant no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming bitch
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MCs and I ate it
So I take it thats the reason Im hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MCs would not be impitant
But pimping it and acting like you could rock a show so
Harder than LLs Rock the Bells but you is a ho now
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered turned on like an appliance
Defiance no we wont have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well Ima stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you aint singing or gonna do a thing about

Your ass forgot so just in case you dont remember me
Ill run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
Its either them or me man kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans packed to capacity
Ill send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If hes acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldnt go out with a bang
I showered the slang simple as A B Cs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with Es
Dethrone MCs and Ima max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
Im greeted with flocks of fellow followers singers
You couldnt make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
fingers
But you can bring yours lets see what you got
But dont front and never try to be what youre not

 introCrank CallsMy name is micky i am a dreamer for thoes ones who love me
I like to wright wright thoes love songs ya i
wake up in the land of glory with my saints i
will tell my story there will be no sham
becausewake up in the land of glory with my
saints i will tell my story there will be a paraid
with glory telling my story how i am micky and this is my story
classic beatbox freestyle mick boogie mixPre UpOh no whats happening to my brain
I cant believe this is happening again
Lava out my lips I flips
Wake up think I have a cramp
Im trying to shove the lava lamp up my fathers ass
I think Im out of gas man
I think I need another mask
Id ask my mother but I think shes laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamps
I think Ill eat some Ambiens like theyre candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abraf-ckingcadabra motherf-cker look whos back
Just like a pendulum Satans pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring
First I Re-up then I Relapse
Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc
And Ill be back with the sequel repeat the cycle
Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see Nyquil
Oh no
Here we go again
When its going to end
Where did it begin
Maybe way back when
Into the well baby Jessica fell
She may have wetted herself
Quit playing get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail
Every day in journals saying how
She wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
Im the medicine man
My medical marijuana was prescribed by a doctor
Shove a typewriter up her
Perez Hiltons ass shit almost forgot that
Hes always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
And f-ck it while Im venting lets shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when hes bending over pretending that he
Didnt say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm I wonder where. Wait I think the cubpoards bare
Stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there
Vicodin like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who am I kidding? I couldnt quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah rehabs nice I had my name up in lights again
You see thats why I cant decipher what life Im in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
It sounds so enticing isnt it nice when Im hype again?
Im nice when Im like this no time to write just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down whatd I write just then?
Man Im about to hyperventilate I just have hyper-tension
I have the type of mental state you couldnt comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think Im your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy the controversy is once again
oh noWhiteboy WastedIts like Im in this dirt digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
All it takes is one song on the radio youre right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Dont suppose an explanation Im owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
Id never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
bout to go throughs tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges mind is saying let it go fuck this
Heart is saying I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through oh you had me pegged the first time
You cant see the truth but its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time you better go and get sewing kit bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone but hes not forgotten
And dont think cause hes been out the pictures so long
That Ive stopped the plottin and still aint coming to get ya
Youre wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him same shit you did to me go!
Have you any idea that shit Ive gone through
Feelings I harbor all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how Im doing
Letters you dont respond to em
Fuck it Im coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on you
Poof then Im gone whoosh
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through oh you had me pegged the first time
You cant see the truth but its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy
Ive been driving around your side of this town
Like  frickin hours and  minutes now
Finally I found your new address park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and Im ducking on the side of your house
See its sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But aint here for ya empathy I dont need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential I peaked
Continue to peep still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way round to the back porch
Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
You dont plan for intruders before hand
Surprised to see me cat got your tongue
Gag chloroform rag gag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans irony spectacular huh
Now whos a faggot you punk
And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
Its just me you and the music now Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait here comes my favorite lyric
Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
Hows this for publicity stunt?
This should be fun
Last album now cause after this youll be officially done
Eminem killed by MampM
Matthew Mitchell
Bitch I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits town is quite near
I hope we dont get stopped no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess  on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
Oh God police! Ahh!
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
New plan Stan
Slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
Well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro its for you
Slim this is for him and Frank Ocean oh hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
Im the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
Im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No its hopeless Im the denial that youre hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
Backs to the wall Im stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged Yeah ‘cause Im talking a lot of shit but Im backing it all up
But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
Im the ringing in your ears
Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
Grab for some water but Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
Im the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult
That with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers personas half a facade
And Matthew and Stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until its gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad but it happens to all of them
Im the hindsight to say I told you so!
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you dont stop after they call you the
Biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
When its time to walk away
Im every guilt trip
The baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If theres anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact dont bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure youre packing a wallop
So one last time Im back
Before it fades into black and its all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers left off
bad guyThe Marshall Mathers LP .
Eminem hellbound
yo. slim shady!
yo. ill fuckin. ill.
ill puke eat it and freak you eww
battle? im too weeded to speak to
the only key that i see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two adidas and beat you
and force feed you em both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
ill lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
youll think i pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you
bitch! i aint no fuckin g im a cannibal
i aint tryin to shoot youim tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
wrap you in rope and plastic stab you with broken glass
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers ahhh!
fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis
im so bananas im showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it
while i sit back and just hope it catches
blow you to fragments
laugh roll you and smoke the ashes
repeat x
I see the light at the end
but every time i take a step it gets dim
tell me is this hell were livin in?
if so heavens got to be better
but if were hellbound whatever lets go down
am i the worst? because i never go to church never
i run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
ima drink til my liver rot see the doc
leave the e.r. then hit a bar for a liquor shot til the liver spot
one day we all gon die
but when i die ima be so high
that ima get up and walk leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
i smoke til i choke and i sex a lot
i got a cross on my chain but its just a rock
now if i pray everynight night
do i still have to hold my trey very tight?
you feel me god? i done did so much shit while on earth
i smoke i drink i curse and to make matters worse
i bust my gun first and then i chat with your corpse
since way back i was one to never like back-talk
see me at the pearly gates in line wearin a nordface
nickel nine at my waist god done lost faith
angels greet me but i dont reply back
just show me to my quarters and oh yeah wheres thai at?
analyze the strength of my game like lee corso
call me a lost soul with a vest on my torso
and of course yo yall know im no stranger to danger
like christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger
i breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
and beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
my pen bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger
tie your wife to the back of a black jag and i drag her
ten blocks untie the bitch and i still bag her
give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
my shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
my flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
everyday i grow more older and more colder
fly you to colorado roll you over with a boulder
i know you want to retaliate but you wont dare
cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just dont care
but every time i take a step it gets dim tell me is this hell were livin in
hellbound with j black masta acehh remixHellboundWhatever
Dre just let it run
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen
Ey yo
I sit back with this pack of zigzags
And this bag of this weed
It gives me the shit needed to be the most meanest MC on this
On this earth cause since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
All this tension dispensing me sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me recently
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When Im eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I dont know you and no I dont owe you a motherfuckin thing
Im not Mr.N Sync and Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr.Friendly I can be a prick if you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me Im lifting you ten feet
In the air I dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of all you
I dont mean to be mean but its all I can be its just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the papers the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the papers the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant and oh its his lyrical content!
The song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at em but not the index or the pinky
Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up when you dont give a fuck
When you wont just put up with the bullshit they pull
Cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
And the heroin where were the parents at?
And look at where its at
Middle America now its a tragedy now its so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way
But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn and its burnin and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the papers the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the papers the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Im so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top on My name is
And pigeon holdin to some poppy sensations
They cop me rotation at rock n roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think Im some wigga who just tries to be black
Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in the why the who what
When and where and the how til Im grabbing my hair and Im tearing it out
Youve been driving me crazy
I cant take it Im racing Im pacing I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get but I cant take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No I wont sign your autograph you can call me an asshole Im glad
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the papers the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the papers the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
the way i am danny lohner remix version bonus trackThe Marshall Mathers LP Bonus Track VersionAnd everyone should get along
Okay children quiet down quiet down
Children Id like toduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian dont throw that 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia 
Good luck Mr. Shady
Hi there little boys and girls 
Today were going to learn how to poison squirrels
But first Id like you to meet my friend Bob 
Say hi Bob Hi Bob Bobs  and still lives with his mom
He dont got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his  year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be just so afraid theyd drop the charge
Till one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job
When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk
But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker
Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block uh
You couldnt even take him to to give Bob a doctor
Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found her
And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And thats the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it its bad for you
See children drugs are bad come on
And if you dont believe me ask your dad raise your hand
And if you dont believe him ask your mom thats right
Shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
So kids say no to drugs thats right
So you dont act like everyone else does uh huh
And theres really nothing else to say sing along
Drugs are just bad mkay
My penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it
Fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut huh?
Speaking of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
Ecstasy its the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you dont do it
Kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final you wont get it back
So dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach  years old
After hanging out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
And decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse
Goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull
His back arches up looks like the McDonalds arches
Hes on Donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
Hey Adam Zach is a jackass look at him.
Cause they took it too so they think its funny
So theyre laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile Zachs in a coma the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicing yoga
And thats the story of Zach the ecstasy maniac
So dont even feed that to squirrels class cause its bad for you
See children drugs are bad thats right
And if you dont believe me ask your dad thats right
And if you dont believe him ask your mom you can
Shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
So kids say no to drugs smoke crack
So you dont act like everyone else does thats right
And theres really nothing else to say Uh huh
Drugs are just bad mkay
And last but not least one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it Yum yum
And then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of em
And sometimes you see things that arent there like what?
Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair
Mr. Shady whats a g-string? its yarn Clair
Women stick them up their behinds go out and wear em
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops did I say magic mushrooms I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swole up like a cows tongue How come?
Cause it comes from a cows dung
See drugs are bad its a common fact
But your mom and dad know thats all that Im good at
But dont be me cause if you grow up and go and OD
Theyre gonna come for me and Ima have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide cause itll be my fault
So dont drugs and do exactly as I dont because Im bad for you
See children drugs are bad uh huh
And if you dont believe me ask your dad put that down
And if you dont believe him ask your mom you can ask
Shell tell you how she does him all the time and she will
So kids say no to drugs say no
So you dont act like everyone else does like I do
And theres really nothing else to say thats right
Drugs are just bad mkay
Come on children clap along 
Sing along children 
Drugs are just bad drugs are just bad 
So dont do drugs 
So therell be more for me Mushrooms killed Kenny!...Ewww ahhh!So fucked up right now.
the kids bonus trackThe Marshall Mathers LP Bonus Track VersionMy teas gone cold Im wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
My teas gone cold Im wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Slim I wrote you but you still aint callin
I left my cell my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways fuck it
Whats been up man hows your daughter?
My girlfriends pregnant too
Im out to be a father
If I have a daughter guess what Im a call her?
Im a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too Im sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didnt want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But Im your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam
I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours your biggest fan
This is Stan
My teas gone cold Im wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Slim you still aint called or wrote
I hope you have the chance I aint mad
I just think its fucked up you dont answer fans
If you didnt want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didnt have to
But you couldve signed an autograph for Matthew
Thats my little brother man
Hes only  years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For  hours and you just said No
Thats pretty shitty man
Youre like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do
I aint that mad though I just dont like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you you would write back
See Im just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre sayin in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put em on
Cause I dont really got shit else
So that shit helps when Im depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
Its like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriends jealous
Cause I talk about you 
But she dont know you like
I know you Slim no one does
She dont know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
Youve gotta call me man
Ill be the biggest fan youll ever lose
Sincerely yours Stan
P.S. We should be together too
My teas gone cold Im wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Mister Im too good to call or write my fans
Thisll be the last package I ever send your ass
Its been six months and still no word
I dont deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on em perfect
So this is my cassette Im sending you
I hope you hear it
Im in the car right now
Im doing  on the freeway
Hey Slim I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know this song by Phil Collins
From the Air in the Night
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didnt then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him
Thats kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now its too late
Im on a thousand downers now Im drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim we could have been together
Think about it you ruined it now
I hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you cant sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you cant breathe without me
See Slim Shut up bitch!
Im trying to talk
Hey Slim thats my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didnt slit her throat I just tied her up
See I aint like you
Cause if she suffocates shell suffer more
And then shell die too
Well gotta go
Im almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?
My teas gone cold Im wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad
Its not so bad
Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner
But Ive just been busy
You said your girlfriends pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look Im really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And heres an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the starter cap
Im sorry I didnt see you at the show
I must have missed you
Dont think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And whats this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin dawg
Cmon how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncin off the walls
When you get down some
And whats this shit about us mean to be together?
That type of shitll make me not want us
To meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that youll be doin just fine
If youd relax a little
Im glad I inspire you
But Stan why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just dont want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didnt say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was... it was you.
Damn.!

patiently waitingThe return of the  kingz Volume Im liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club shit I was taught if you see these on fire
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park no fire department
So you might not hear sirens at all
But dont be alarmed if I sound off
Something just aint right with me dawg
A martyr on a private charter whose life could be harder
Widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart Im slightly retarded
But tonight Im starting shit Im feeling self righteous
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Looking to box with anybody disorderly conduct
Ill fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of the LOX bananas manic Im going in shock
Frantic Im trapped in a closet
Panic attack cause Im claustrophobic
No faggot I mean I cant maneuver from movement
Cause I have no room for improvement
Im practically squashed unpacked it and boxed it
Toxic hands are arsenic flammable bars examine the content
Bar exam start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles lambs thatll slaughter
Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
Black out Zach Galifianakis gallons of Vodka
But that gal has some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and Im conscious
What happened doc? I passed out again
Alcohols making me break into vacants naked
Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter hungover
No underwear grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Max in my closet preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros possum skin giraffe and a dolphin
Fin Dockers OshKoshes drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers
But its like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers but I dont have any boxers
And Im standing here naked hangover still wasted
Like paper you write raps on obnoxious
Yo why does it always sound like Im grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that Ill battle em all Ill battle a mall
Ill stand there and yell that at a wall
Until the mannequin doll scatter the inanimate objects
That Im battering all shatter and fall
Cause I hear the track and Im starting to get fucking amped
Imma spark plug Im like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking backIm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause yall could get jumped
And Id catch the battery charge but
I got a hunch like your back when its arching
When I start attacking your squadron
Youll feel like MasterCard when Im charging
So take a swipe at me Im coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack of Wisconsin
Thats nutbag that Im talking who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Dont get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus bags of Vuitton and all
Ill push a bitch into oncoming traffic just watch this
Stretched tinted black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door is laughable
My next whores gonna have mechanical arms
Thatll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
Its like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
Ill laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malign now shes slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her God dammit I am misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster throw her off a balcony
Just so happens shes fond of algae
Cause now shes faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes aint strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit you fags couldnt shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift em up boost the energy
Klepto Im back to rip shop up but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long Ive been killing this shit its easy
Kidnapping your mom cause Im still in this bitch thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey Chandra Levy and Gary Condit
Em Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse get on some bullshit
Perhaps Ill launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamars Control verse
And perform Fack in concert
Yo I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
Ill stick around
And put up with my crap so long for
Whats the attraction mama?
Is it the fact that Im a walking talking actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose thats pointing at you mama?
Who knows at this point its always poking so meh
Still get along with this voice cause thats the monster
So do-si-do with a sociopath everyone who knows me knows that
What they dont know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio meh
She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar oh why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants but they on fire
So am I-a wooh Cappadonna cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas crap in your stocking
Im wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you cant even find em
Jack Santa Claus snap Rudolphs antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing the head gasket at Bed Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar splash of Bizarre Thrasher and Aerosmith
And Im a spectacular archer feed count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla half dragon and Bob Dylan
Bandwagoners Im kicking the damn stragglers off and Im strangling em
Smack Kim Basinger on a ass
shady xvCompilationI feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals glue sniffin pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I dont know if Im in Tennessee Chicago or Houston
In the corner tryna seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I wont even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too plus Im on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off Im on mushrooms so fuck all of you…
Roses are violet mollys are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion its all an illusion
Its probably the shrooms Im on
Cuz I think I started hallucinatin
Cuz I just thought I
heard Jay Electronica amp Odd Futures new shit
amp all I can do is follow the music
amp end up wit Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Filling water balloons wit nail polish remova.
Just a pop em and wallow in fumes I…
feel uptight I got to get loosa
Afta I finish polishin off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice so Im not as diluted
Cuz all this delusion got me seein shit
Excusez-moi but that hoochie did pass
Ya see her ass? Wouldnt make her my main squeeze
But juicier ass it belongs in a juicer
Its mouth waterin too so I walked up to it like…
 Im Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? Ill introduce ya
Oh Im a mysogonist too but Im not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin off on the youth
uh!
A chronic abuser…
and not only user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of ya losers
Got a bazooka a shotgun a ruger a Glock amp a nuke
amp a Rottweiler too and Im not in the mood so…
When I say Im bringin the Tech out
Im not comin to repair your fucking electronic computers
God…
Im gonna puke Im so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofa
Im TORE UP…
demolished Im fucking stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are… LNy TuN
The box of reusable latex gloves amp the socks amp the shoes
 replace Nextel-Veronicas boobs
amp the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in a glove box
In a blue Honda wit used condoms were clues the…
girl was just not the one suitable for…
Right fo me will change me rearrange my head  be just right for…
you amp me dont laugh please listen!
Dont laaaugh…
youralltraptinmyhead!
Thought Id give in to the pressure
Collapse amp crumble…
perhaps relapsing under that
Well thats a bunch of crap
In the clutch Im the Capn Crunch of rap
amp Im sick of acting humble thats enough of that
Fuck that shit cut the sack
Like its a natural reaction
Thats why Im actually trapped in this shoving match
Cuz push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit still mad
Disgruntled had some struggles yeah
but that passionate hungers back
A fantastic juggling act
amp the way I flip my tongue on the track
Its like verbal acrobatics but in fact…
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fucking crashed my hovercraft
Afta I strapped the duffel bag to my back
amp stuck the massive punchin bag in it
An elastic bungee strap rubber plaster a thumb tack
amp a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic amp fuckin snapped
Jumped amp splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back recovered back-flipped
amp landed on a gymnastic tumble-mat!…
amp for my last trick lunge on back
latch on a N.A.S.A. shuttle flap fuckin snapped the rudder in half
Chuckled amp laughed buttaled my last rebuttal
amp just asked him to come crash
amp I go grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
amp ceramic construction hat rubbed my magic mushroom tat  luck
then splat…
get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up then gas lungs collapsed
amp thats mo likely than finding someone thats
Right fo me will change me rearrange my head  be
Just Right for me will change me rearrange my head  be just right for…
you amp me dont laugh please listen!
Dont laaaugh…

Couple of shots of Jäger

Flooded wit thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably sum of ya got  thinking
Youre top  aint ya? stop cuz ya fuckas are talking crazy
amp stop interrupting youre not even up in that conversation!…
Whether youre punchin a clock or famous
Underground pop or nameless whateva yo job is
I came  fuck wit yo occupation
Youre thinking just cuz ya came in with scrubs
amp ya brought the scalpel amp sponge
The oxygen tank amp the suction amp shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once ya done swapped names wit him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan if you dug him up -gt Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles bacon
a fucking McDonalds egg amp cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table
Then bump it amp knock it shake it…
Jumped amp got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said
FUCK IT!
amp lost my patience
they all woke up from sedation
Aint none of ya Doctor Dre so then what does it got ya thinking

Dont laaaugh…
youralltraptinmyhead!
right for meSHADYXVAnother day another hotel the inside of it is nice though
Oh well this is my life so as I go and try to close for the nights show
To see how far that line goes still blows my mind show business
Guess Ill just never get so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because alls I ever did
Was just say the shit I wouldve wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please dont make me some type of hero
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someones in like a son of a bitch at anothers expense
Im fuckin relentless its fucked when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses stuck on the fence
With a balance beam. If I seem unbalanced its challenging
But my conscience allows me to think the most foulish childish things
Without even blinking without even thinkin about
All the stinkin amounts of people that seems to be reachin for the crowds
Theyre screaming in The Palace sold out this evening
But now as I lay me down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin but keep overachievin
Cause what its stole from me Ive barely broken even
I know its a fine fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know its a fine fine line
Living in a hole dying
So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin ordeals Im so vain
I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what its like here
Cause this vanity surrounded by all these lights
Yeah its like a nightmare
I said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I dont like how I see myself so I open the Bible to Isaiah
Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
Cause this ice layer
I skate ons a nice way of putting it but I like stayin
Feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
Its funny this house is quite big but it aint when you cant leave it
And I feel so isolated nice I made it
But its like I paid the price of fame twice I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song vicious cycle aint it?!
Then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin the line
This goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you dont know
If your conscience is sayin I told you so
Cause you dont even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or you sold your soul
I know its a fine fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know its a fine fine line
Living in a hole dying
And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back
To me
I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin the mics
Ill never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now Im diamond
I cant even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when Ive been
Stuck in this house hibernatin
Hate even going outside
It sucks sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse I dont even want to buy nothin
I just wanna fuckin walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin bout life and
Everything about it I miss which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow I must have had Alzheimers
Long time since I shouted them out bout time
Cause its been on my mind lately how
Zee you always supported me
You vouched I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too you slept on my couch
And Ive been thinkin bout the time when I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhymings all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside Ill Ill always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I
I know its a fine fine line
Living in a hole dying
I know its a fine fine line
Living in a hole dying
But I keep walkin the line...
fine lineSHADYXVIm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club shit I was taught if you see these on fire
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park no fire department
So you might not hear sirens at all
But dont be alarmed if I sound off
Something just aint right with me dawg
A martyr on a private charter whose life could be harder
Widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart Im slightly retarded
But tonight Im starting shit Im feeling self righteous
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Looking to box with anybody disorderly conduct
Ill fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of the LOX bananas manic Im going in shock
Frantic Im trapped in a closet
Panic attack cause Im claustrophobic
No faggot I mean I cant maneuver from movement
Cause I have no room for improvement
Im practically squashed unpacked it and boxed it
Toxic hands are arsenic flammable bars examine the content
Bar exam start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles lambs thatll slaughter
Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
Black out Zach Galifianakis gallons of Vodka
But that gal has some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and Im conscious
What happened doc? I passed out again
Alcohols making me break into vacants naked
Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter hungover
No underwear grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Max in my closet preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros possum skin giraffe and a dolphin
Fin Dockers OshKoshes drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers
But its like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers but I dont have any boxers
And Im standing here naked hangover still wasted
Like paper you write raps on obnoxious
Yo why does it always sound like Im grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that Ill battle em all Ill battle a mall
Ill stand there and yell that at a wall
Until the mannequin doll scatter the inanimate objects
That Im battering all shatter and fall
Cause I hear the track and Im starting to get fucking amped
Imma spark plug Im like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking backIm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause yall could get jumped
And Id catch the battery charge but
I got a hunch like your back when its arching
When I start attacking your squadron
Youll feel like MasterCard when Im charging
So take a swipe at me Im coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack of Wisconsin
Thats nutbag that Im talking who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Dont get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus bags of Vuitton and all
Ill push a bitch into oncoming traffic just watch this
Stretched tinted black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door is laughable
My next whores gonna have mechanical arms
Thatll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
Its like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
Ill laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malign now shes slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her God dammit I am misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster throw her off a balcony
Just so happens shes fond of algae
Cause now shes faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes aint strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit you fags couldnt shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift em up boost the energy
Klepto Im back to rip shop up but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long Ive been killing this shit its easy
Kidnapping your mom cause Im still in this bitch thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey Chandra Levy and Gary Condit
Em Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse get on some bullshit
Perhaps Ill launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamars Control verse
And perform Fack in concert
Yo I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
Ill stick around
And put up with my crap so long for
Whats the attraction mama?
Is it the fact that Im a walking talking actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose thats pointing at you mama?
Who knows at this point its always poking so meh
Still get along with this voice cause thats the monster
So do-si-do with a sociopath everyone who knows me knows that
What they dont know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio meh
She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar oh why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants but they on fire
So am I-a wooh Cappadonna cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas crap in your stocking
Im wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you cant even find em
Jack Santa Claus snap Rudolphs antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing the head gasket at Bed Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar splash of Bizarre Thrasher and Aerosmith
And Im a spectacular archer feed count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla half dragon and Bob Dylan
Bandwagoners Im kicking the damn stragglers off and Im strangling em
Smack Kim Basinger on a ass
shadyxvSHADYXVLast month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didnt work and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level  Land of the Unsigned
We dont play those games
Would you listen here?
What Im doin here?
Get me outta here
We dont play those games
This is gettin wild
Can you tell me how?
Let me out now
We dont play those games
Howd I get in here?
Let me outta here
What Im doin here?
We dont play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap K
I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp drainin my life twenty percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was tryin to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered somethin I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill
I made it to the next level Above Ground
My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And thats when this AampR crawled from under a rock
And start shootin opinions I stop drop and I roll
Cause if they was to hit me theyd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof tryin to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I wouldve stayed down in the dark caves
Im runnin towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holdin a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died game over
rap k with j black masta aceHellboundGuess who? You miss me?

Oh Amy Rehab never looked so goodI cant wait Im going back! Ha ha woo! Dr. Dre  yeah
we made you single version bonus trackRelapse Deluxe Versionyawns Yeah look
If I wouldve rap about the crap thats out thats the route
you probably want me to take cause youre just dyin to know what I think
Here my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin about Paul Wall youd probably crap in your pants
Cause Im white and hes white so hes like
my competition I mean right? Nope
Paul Wall is dope and so is Bubba so
blblblbl pbbbbt B-b-b-b-b-b but
I dont compete with nobody
I just go hard do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents do donuts
Sometimes I play possum like Im asleep its awesome
Im like a sleepin giant and when I awake Im like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite break
And sink my teeth in em and fill em full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em
And let em know that I just dont feel em
And smack him with the backward E the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why look em dead in the eye then waste em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g–g-goes
One-two-three chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three that aint the hook now follow me
Theres nothing else for me to say my public adores me
Everybody bores me theyre just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers Come nearer

my darling bonus trackRelapse Deluxe VersionPsst hey listen
I love my job
It makes me feel like superman
Can you fly I can wanna see
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congress
Has been a problem for the longest I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really shouldve fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
Theres a ray
Theres a light
Theres a hope
Theres a spark
But when planets collide
Theyll never see eye to eye
Until they decide
To set the differences aside
And this is why
Only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead
And feel the vibe because
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldnt take lyrics so serious It might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
Its stupid aint it I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot pointy nosed bleached blonde
Cuz I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like
Ill be here when yall are gone re-building
World revolving still evolving still Slim
How many kids will copy probably millions
But Ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
Alarmin rate common denominate
Add it up and youll see thats why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make Slim youre great
But wait cant you see Im only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cause man I see it feel it live it but its inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you aint
But they dont understand that Ive been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you cant just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And its such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
stimulate non album versionCleanin Out My ClosetStep by step heart to heart
Left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino
It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?
It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentioning Suge
And that was just outta respect for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
While hes all over TV down talking the man
Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
Im still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute because
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dying
But now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
The shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it?
Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rapping
We actually tried to stop the  and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasnt going to go after him
Until Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it  smash him mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?
Well fuck it that mothafucka could get it too fuck him then
But Im so busy being pissed off I dont stop to think
That we just inherited s beef with Murder Inc
And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
We still have soldiers thats on the front line
Thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the To show em we love em back and let them know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I aint tryna have none of people hurt or murdered
It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im copping
Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit popping
Off at your jaws well then I can cause frankly Im sick of talking
Im not going to let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause
like toy soldiers single version explicitLike Toy SoldiersHey listen
I love my job it makes me feel like Superman
Can you fly? I can
Wanna see?
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really shouldve fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark theres a ray theres a light
Theres a hope theres a spark
But when planets collide theyll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead and feel the vibe because
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
Its stupid aint it? I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot pointy nosed bleached blond
Cuz I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin constantly using
The constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
Ill be here when yall are gone re building
World revolving still evolving still Slim
How many kids will copy? Probably millions
But Ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin rate common denominate
Add it up and youll see thats why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make Slim youre great
But wait cant you see Im only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cuz man I see it feel it live it
But its inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you aint
But they dont understand that Ive been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you cant just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And its such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partying
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you
stimulate non album trackCleanin Out My ClosetSometimes I just feel like quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight why do I still write
Sometimes its hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
But Im still white sometimes I just hate life
Somethin aint right hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da it aint my fault
Great then I falls my insides crawl
and I clam up wham I just slam shut
I just cant do it my whole manhoods
just been stripped I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then slip
Man fuck this shit yo Im goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this  Mile Road
Im a man Ima make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back
 Mile Road And Im gone I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
And go follow the footsteps Im makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this  Mile Road
Im walkin these train tracks tryin to regain back
the spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan mommas got a new man
Poor little baby sister she dont understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Aint no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset cause I aint blew up yet
Its like I grew up but I aint grow me two nuts yet
Dont gotta rep my step dont got enough pep
The pressures too much man Im just tryin to do whats best
And I try sit alone and I cry
Yo I wont tell no lie not a moment goes by
That I dont pray to the sky please Im beggin you God
Please dont let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo Im tellin you dawg Im bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby Im never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And Ima be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own Ill make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this  Mile Road
You gotta live it to feel it you didnt you wouldnt get it
Or see what the big deal is why it wasnt the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
Its different its a certain significance a certificate
of authenticity youd never even see
But its everything to me its my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
whos incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet Im still unsigned havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go
Who must I show to bust my flow
Where must I go who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I aint havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet Im startin to doubt shit
Im feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum yo my clothes aint about shit
if the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And its cold tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like Im on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up but one thing I dont want
is pity from no one the city is no fun
There is no sun and its so dark
Sometimes I feel like Im just bein pulled apart
Im torn in my limbs by each one of my friends
Its enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot sometimes I just know not
what Im doin I just blow my head is a stove top
I just explode the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I dont got
But Ive learned its time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Aint no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge suddenly its a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now Im free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from  Mile Road
the  mile left behindMore Maximum EminemIm getting by with my wicked ways
Im loading up and Im taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Im getting by with my wicked ways
Im loading up and Im taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? Its a rare condition
Its what youre suffering from
When you simply dont care if its an
 degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning
And you cant see the bitchs hair is frizzing
Cause you got the windows up
Blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil aint on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did something to me personally
Used to get bullied so Id cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap Im the shit faggot sniff it
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground still cant tell em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park screaming Im proud
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
And Im still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin
I dont give a fuck I dont play!
Bitch you think you saw this basket first?
Youre ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Minds like a pile of clay
Whens the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gaping hole in it
Flipped out ripped down the drapes
Tied em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this aint got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
But by the way thoughts are getting darker by the day
Im a combination of Skylar Grey Tyler the Creator and Violent J
Its a fuckin miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face Im insane
Every rhyme I say sons you like an ultra violet ray
Im selling hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
. so come on and pile a plate
Im throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme Im spittin while Im shittin on competition
In the meantime its always mean time
Im getting by with my wicked ways
Im loading up and Im taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Im getting by with my wicked ways
Im loading up and Im taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Ive been a career asshole
I dont see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
Im coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
Cause that cougars a MILF shes the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic Imma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion my suggestions Kaopectate
If it feels like Im running away with the game
Its cause I am dont speculate spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
Cry til you get puffy eyes red faced
But Im leaving on this jet plane
You aint fly youre an airhead
And Im sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage aint gonna fit in my storage overhead space
Cause it just aint big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words dont try to put your heart in a headcase
Cause baby stable mentally I aint
I need my meds I peed my bed
Im going blind I dont see my legs
I keep on falling down no wonder you cant stand me I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
And youd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes now peep my game
Cause Im bout it bout it
Like a like a fucking fucking
Echo echo... Psych Psycho on a cyclone cycle
Spiraling here I go Im outta control like no
Other mic go stab you til the knife goes - dull
Im nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
Coz Imma sock it to you
Dyke ho you dont like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
Im finna blow the mic the whole night so
Strike up the fucking maestro Im nitro
And hi ho hand me my shovel Im liable to dig my hole
Deeper and its off to H.E double hockey sticks I go
Im getting by with my wicked ways
Im loading up and Im taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Im getting by with my wicked ways
Im loading up and Im taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Ohh please be empty please be empty please be empty
Thank you God
Shit...
Is that a girl?
Im gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out and get gay into the A.M
And lay with  guys naked and let myself show let myself show
Buttfuck it suck it pull it tug it
Lifes too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody everybody
Circle jerk touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then
Blow it out your ass
wicked waysThe Marshall Mathers LP  Bonus DiscWhat is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare
I used to think I had bad luck but I wasnt superstitious
til one day I grew suspicious when I stepped on a crack
On Aunt Ednas stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didnt work so we moved
Back to Missouri from Michigan from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery I cant do this again
Mom please stick to a decision discipline last thing I wanna do
Is listen shes like Lex Luthor bitch her rules are Krypton-
-ite to the walls and Ive lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into em running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
I remember it clearly even today
Move back to Michigan again to live with my Grandma nan
Always itching for something to do was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered
This DJ who was mixing I say it to this day if you aint listened
To the wizard you aint have a fucking clue what you was missing
Id zone out with my headphones all I remember doings wishing for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch its all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J cooling system
Think I finally maneuvered to  Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this thats how I know my mission
Little boom box booming spitting practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit couldnt wait to play him my new shit
Hed go complete ballistic go through the roof for his shit
Its like we knew the instant we touched a mic that both of us
Too existed to do this shit never quit too persistent
We are the underground empire
Started a group of misfits Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together there aint no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop cause if they caught you slipping
Theyd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
And you forgot your written opportunity knocks once it aint knocking again
It tried ding-dong ditching shit I fucking got that bitch
In a headlock cut off his oxygen Slim its not cordial
Like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind now I got my pot to piss in
Spot in that top position hopping over that opposition
Looking like a dog is pissing leg up on the competition
Promising complete dominance Sugar Ray Robinson
Im in a league Muhammads in Alis my colleague bombing em
Probably end up on top of em like stomping em like Ndamukong
Im Russian like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme I spit in a rhymes face
So name the time place to battle bitch Im still in that mind state
Dont make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts shit no wonder youre sore losers
Now wheres your bluebirds? Ooh
No more tripping in bird shit this songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this discouraging
The Rap Games God but the names not James Todd Im just a wordsmith
So let these words lift cause all I got is bars
For you dumbbells and doors aint working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first and you aint got to wear
No shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served bloodthirst revenge of a nerds
They will not escape my vengeance
And Im the kid with them ears like Dumbos gone
With the Uncle Ron Im turning into an unhumble Don
You blind dumb hoes all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So stop the show but I need a drum roll fore I go on
Better back away from the front row get launched up your arm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fucking Jumbotron
Im a juggernaut you do not wanna crumble you bambacluts
Ill leave you stretched out like a fucking yawn
So mow the fucking lawn your asses are blades of grass
And Im fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
Soot charred debris floating like Oakwood
Was burning return of the no good and I dont quit
And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane
And I dont quit wont change its like a Groundhogs Day
So crowd around yall cause you may so you cant pop your head
Im not so sure I want to know from once it came
But the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed
There before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing
groundhog dayThe Marshall Mathers LP .
One thousand different houses and munchausen
Imma make you wanna punch out some fuckin one ouch
What the fuckd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch dont take shit for granted
And dont take shit give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothings riding on it but your privates are youre fighting for
So you fight scratch you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like theyre gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants whoop your ass and flash it on em
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No ones more ig-norant then you fuckin four in the morning youre at the laboratory
storming
Like theres nothing thats more important
MCs you better consider this a formal warning youre in for it
Girl what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I aint finished bitch
I meant in half oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say Im a spoiled little baby
But
Nobody puts baby in the corner
Im only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby gets mad
And gets to throwing a tantrum
Hell fucking flip on ya
Cus nobody puts baby in the corner
Im only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby gets mad
And gets to throwing a tantrum
Hell fucking flip on ya
What goes through an addicts brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why youre back but you dont rap the same
And youre looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar ray leonard wouldnt sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hookers coat
When you say youre a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who cant think of shit
Anything of wit thats interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rockys back wheres my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
Im what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man Im a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom Id never be the same after
Now Im back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So lets eat cos Im famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled
Nobody puts baby in the corner
Im only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby gets mad
And gets to throwing a tantrum
Hell fucking flip on ya
Cus nobody puts baby in the corner
Im only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby gets mad
And gets to throwing a tantrum
Hell fucking flip on ya
So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
Thats like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didnt mention
I lose my mind and my temper
Youll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
Im in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
Im an enigma
Fuck it lets get to the meat balls
Im gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right theres a sledge-hammer
And pajamas standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head til Russell lets him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god cus If I go off the edge
T.I aint talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart ah nah
More like a smart slob part blob
Thatll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging Im blood flinging
Theres nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
Cos when Im pushed
I end up swinging up
Nobody puts baby in the corner
Im only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby gets mad
And gets to throwing a tantrum
Hell fucking flip on ya
Cus nobody puts baby in the corner
Im only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby gets mad
And gets to throwing a tantrum
Hell fucking flip on ya
babyThe Marshall Mathers LP .
Yeah trying to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred
Im in a strange place
I feel like Mae when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like Im caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause Im mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace Im working at is dangerous
Theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting em
Cause thats where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you - aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes Jays Waynes and the Drakes
Im frustrated cause aint no more NSync now Im all out of whack
Im all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
Im going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is Im strapped
For battles sucka - duck crawl out the back
Its a bar fight prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking mirrors also
And I aint stopping til the swear jars full
You done called every woman a slut
But youre forgetting Sarah Marshall Palin
Oh my bad. Slut
And next time I show to in court Ill be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like Thats sharp how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass youre lucky I dont tear it off you
And jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
Youre so fucking gravy Marshall I should start calling you au jus
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin take this beat now its all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I couldve changed the world if it wasnt for this verse
So satanic K-Mart chains panic
Cause they cant even spin back the curse words
Cause theyre worse when theyre reversed motherfucker
Rape your mother kill your parents And these kids are like parrots they run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming fuck shit fuck adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like merits
Fuck that - Id rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics
Dreamy eyes but my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition ha ha
Hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius whos bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where Im at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
Theres darkness closing in evil twin
There it goes again my evil twin
It controls my pen but that aint me its my evil twin
Then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin
But hes just a friend
Who pops up now and again
So dont blame me evil twin
Just blame him its my evil twin
I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin
Welcome back to the land of the living my friend
You have slept for quite some time
So whos left Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah F with Christina I aint fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic Excedrin Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol s feel like Im burning to death but Im freezing
Bed ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger my suicide notes barely legible read the
Bottom its signed by the Joker Lorena said I never can leave her
Shed sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch Give up my dick for pussy?
Id be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally I vent heat register Jesus
Ever since ---- Dresden it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps I met DeShaun
At Osborn Id never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for em
They were sleeping I made em stop snorin
Made them break out the popcorn
Now Ive been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming Fuck the police like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five bitch Im top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac whore
And I got an Evil Twin
So who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spots for?
And crazy as I am Im much tamer than him
And Im nuts then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no ones insaner than Slim look at that evil grin
Evil twin please come in what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look whos back with a crab up his ass
Like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
And youre all aware I dont got it all upstairs
Guess thats why Im an addict and its so small up there
Peace to Whitney jeez just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause Im so sick of being the truth I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh LMFAO no way Jo-
Se Baez couldnt beat this rap OJ no
Hooray Im off the hook like Casey Anthony hey ho Hey-ho!
I sound like Im trying to sing the fucking to Hip Hop Hooray no
Im hollering you got bottom-end like an --
 and I base whether were fucking off that instead of your face so
Let your low end raise yo
Tango what you think ho? Slow dancing or bowling?
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What you think Im looking for romance cause Im lonely?
Change that tune you aint got a remote chance to control me
Ho Im only vulnerable when I got a bo-ner
Superman try to fuck me over it wont hurt
Dont try to fix me Im broke so I dont work
So are you but youre broke cause you dont work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced yall to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same bitch
evil twin silence ken skitThe Marshall Mathers LPMusic is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering my hearts jittering
Just you and i
Not tonight come tomorrow
When evrythings sunny and bright sunny and bright
No no no come tomorrow cause then
Well be waiting in the moonlight
Well go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time dont mean a thing
When youre by my side
Please stay awhile
You know I never could forsee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Cant you see that I just dont know
No not tonight not tomorrow
Evrythings gonna be alright sunny and bright
Wait and see if tomorrow well be
As happy as were feeling tonight
Well go walking in the moonlight well be happy
Walking in the moonlight
I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Lets enjoy tonight
just you and I just you and i
Just you and i
Cant you see that weve gotta be together
Be together just you and I just you and i
No more questions just you and i

ShadyAftermath recording artist...
Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D.
D back in the news again today...
Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation
continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists hes just taking a break
but doubters believe hes retiring leaving us all to askWill the real Slim Shady please stand up?
So this is it this is what I wished for
Just isnt how I envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shitd be different
Theres somethin changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it
And it became my cocaine I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert I was rakin in the dough rollin in green
Had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine
But I was losin my freedom there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen and just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it every CD critics gave it a 
then three years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint passed yet
A couple more years that shitll be Illmatic
And eight years later Im still at it
Divorced re-married a felon a father sleepin pill addict
And this is real talk I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I got a letter from a fan that said hes been prayin for me
Every day and for some reason its been weighin on my mind heavy
Cause I dont read every letter I get
But somethin told me to go ahead and open it
But why would someone pray for you when they dont know you?
You didnt pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where Im at Ive already told you
at least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but Ive already got God on my side
And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it?
Just watchin it from a opposite standpoint man boy its got to look
nuts and thats the only word I can think of
right now on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit
So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
careful what you wish for bonus trackRelapse Deluxe VersionYo if you could just for one minute
Or one split second in time forget everything
Everything that bothers you or your problems
Everything and follow me
If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand it passes through it
If I can grasp it and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through em to make you put your ass into it
And thats when you hit the roof because you cant sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it your movements become fast and fluent
Youre mashin to it moshing until youre black and bluish
And shit youre acting foolish this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True its chaotic but its got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight so make it last and you better just
Lose yourself in this music this moment we own it
We wont never let it go go you better move yourself
Because tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
Cause when we descend together we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync if youll excuse the pun
But if you close loose it once I mean if you could let shit go
Relax take a breath and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make em feel the feeling that Im feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night wont end til I get finished
So close the shades makin sure no light gets in it
The skies the limit tonight because the nights infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck because they just like whats spinnin
His life was spinnin the whole entire night just spinnin
Like lifes beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin in it
lose yourself demo versionSHADYXVMy teas gone cold Im wondering why I.
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window.
and I cant see at all
And even if I could itll all be graybut your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so badits not so bad.
Dear Slim I wrote you but you still aint calling
I left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn you must not-a got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
but anyways fuck it whats been up? Man hows your daughter?
My girlfriends pregnant too Im bout to be a father
If I have a daughter guess what Ima call her?
Ima name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too Im sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didnt want him
I know you probably hear this everyday but Im your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too that shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this man hit me backjust to chat truly yours your biggest fan
This is Stan
Dear Slim you still aint called or wrote I hope you have a chance
I aint mad - I just think its FUCKED UP you dont answer fans
If you didnt wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didnt have to but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
Thats my little brother man hes only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for youfour hours and you just said No.
Thats pretty shitty man - youre like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do
I aint that mad though I just dont like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if Id write you
you would write back - see Im just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day I drift away and put em on
cause I dont really got shit else so that shit helps when Im depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
Its like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriends jealous cause I talk about you 
But she dont know you like I know you Slim no one does
She dont know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man Ill be the biggest fan youll ever lose
Sincerely yours Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too
Dear Mister-Im-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fansthisll be the last package I ever send your ass
Its been six months and still no word - I dont deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on em perfect
So this is my cassette Im sending you I hope you hear it
Im in the car right now Im doing  on the freeway
Hey Slim I drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air of the Night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didnt then Phil saw it all then at a show he found him?
Thats kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now its too late - Im on a  downers now Im drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim we coulda been together think about it
You ruined it now I hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you cant sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you cant BREATHE without me
See Slim screaming Shut up bitch! Im trying to talk!
Hey Slim thats my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
but I didnt slit her throat I just tied her up see I aint like you
cause if she suffocates shell suffer more and then shell die too
Well gotta go Im almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot howm I supposed to send this shit out?
. . Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriends pregnant now how far along is she?
Look Im really flattered you would call your daughter that
and heres an autograph for your brotherI wrote it on the Starter cap
Im sorry I didnt see you at the show I musta missed you
Dont think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But whats this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning doggcmon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And whats this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shitll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself I think that youll be doing just fine
if you relax a little Im glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just dont want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to
Come to think about it his name was. it was you
Damn!
stan live at radio  The Marshall Mathers  Deluxe VersionIm not afraid Im not afraid!
Yeah
To take a stand to take a stand
Its been a ride
Everybody everybody
I guess I had to
Come take my hand come take my hand
Go to that place to get to this one
Well walk this world together through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin you know that youre not alone
If youre tryin to get out
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road
Just follow me Ill get you there
You can try read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em
But you wont take the sting out these words before I say em
Cause aint no way Ima let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say Ima do something I do it I dont give a damn what you think
Im doin this for me so fuck the world
Feed it beans its gassed up if it thinks its stopping me
Ima be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtably
And all those who look down on me Im tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to that last Relapse album
Hes still shittin whether hes on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first for better or worse
Hes married to the game like a fuck-you for Christmas
His gift is a curse forget the earth hes got
The urge to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
Im not afraid Im not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just lettin you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road
Okay quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shouldnt have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know its a rap
You said you was the king you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings instead of getting crowned youre getting capped
And to the fans Ill never let you down again Im back
I promise to never go back on that promise in fact
Lets be honest that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax I aint goin back to that now
All Im tryin to say is get back click clack pow
Cause I aint playin around its the game called circlin
I dont know how Im way too up to back down
But I think Im still tryin to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But its time to exorcise these demons these motherfuckers are doing jumping-jacks now
Im not afraid Im not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just lettin you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road
And I just cant keep living this way
So starting today Im breaking out of this cage
Im standing up Ima face my demons
Im manning up Ima hold my ground
Ive had enough now Im so fed up
Tryin to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And dont even realize what you did believe me you
Ive been through the ringer but take it through little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead no more beef flingers
No more drama from now I wanna promise to focus only
On handlin my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquour counter up
Cause Im raisin the bar I shoot for the moon
But Im too busy gazin at stars I feel amazin
And Im not afraid Im not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
Well walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just lettin you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road
not afraid live at radio  The Marshall Mathers  Deluxe VersionA lotta people ask me
Where the fuck Ive been at the last few years
Shit I dont know
But I do know im back now haha

Dig me up broken tibias fibias yeah fix me up
 sluts all of them dyin from asphyxia
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups toxins boxes of oxy pads
Enough oxy cotton to send a fuckin ox to rehab
Whack job in a bag and a black stalkin cap
Jackin off to a hockey mask at a boxin match
He cant say that yes he can
I just did faggot now guess again
You better text message to your next of kin
Tell em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Throw a fuckin lesbian in wetzy men
So faggidy faggidy faggidy raggidy Ann and Andy
No raggidy Andy and Andy no it cant be it cant be
Yes it can be the fuckin Antichrist is back
Danny and Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville calamity
Goddamn it insanity pills fanny pack filled with zanies
Through every nook and cranny lookin for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk negligee lookie
Razor blades with me to make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline make up layin on the table with weed
Slim Shady shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out of the fuckin toilet when youre takin a pee
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
Six semen samples  strands of hair
Found at the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe and canopy beds
And glad bags yeah glad to be back
Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fuckin doctor I aint understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton I aint enlightened
Bitin into a fuckin Vicadin like Im a Viking
Oh lighten the strikin might be a fuckin sign I need a psychic
Evaluation fuck Jason its Friday the th
That means is just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin lesbian shouldnt have had her legs in the way

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ill disappear youll wonder how
Lookin for me Im underground
So tell the critics Im back and Im comin to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable cannibal shootin animal
Light up a cannon and have him catapult addin a dog
Captain of the cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers lookin like a liar swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Voorhees with a 
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fuckin nectarine
And sat him in a fuckin fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin wiffle bat Drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch ooh
Lookin like I got in a fuckin pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity can it be vanity? Where is the humanity?
And havin a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Cut your fuckin head off and ask you where you headed off to
Get it headed off to? Medic this headaches awful
This anesthetics pathetic sos this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin my hard taco
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now

Tap dancin all over the beat itll jump off the page and spit itself
Yes its the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rap
So Imma fuck til I die yeah Imma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death Id rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height step on the gas and accelerate
Imma need two mics
Cuz the way that Im feelin tonight everything I can just do right
Theres nothing that I can do wrong
Im too strong and Im just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming bust it excuse the corny metaphor
But theyll never catch up to all this energy that Ive mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin process
Tryna process this loss is makin me nauseous
But this depression aint takin me hostage
Ive been patiently watchin this game pacin these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew Id come out of this slump rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And Imma show em blow em out the water slaughter em homes
Im on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie I know Im never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game Im going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight I was on my way to see you
You told me nah Doody youre not layin on that table I knew
I was gonna make it soon as you said think of Hailie I knew
There wasnt no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord Im so thankful please dont think that I dont feel grateful I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody

But thats alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I cant tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now theres a steel knife  in my windpipe
I cant breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right its like Im in flight
High off her love drunk from her hate its like Im huffin paint
And I love her the more I suffer I suffocate
And right before Im about to drown she resuscitates
Me she fucking hates me and I love it wait
Where you going Im leaving you no you aint
Come back were running right back here we go again
Its so insane cause when its going good its going great
Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane
But when its bad its awful I feel so ashamed
I snapped whos that dude? I dont even know his name
I laid hands on her Ill never stoop so low again
I guess I dont know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when youre with em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin yeah them chills used to get em
Now youre gettin fuckin sick of lookin at em
Youd swore youd never hit em never do nothing to hurt em
Now youre in each others face spewing venom in your words when you spit em
You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em
Throw em down pin em so lost in them moments when youre in em
Its the rage that took over it controls ya both
So they say youre best to go your separate ways guess that they dont know ya
Cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over
Its a different day sound like broken records playin over
But you promised her next time youll show restraint
You dont get another chance life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess thats why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things did things that we didnt mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns same routine
But your tempers just as bad as mine is youre the same as me
But when it comes to love youre just as blinded baby please
Come back it wasnt you baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems
Maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
Next time Im pissed Ill aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time there will be no next time I apologizeeven though I know its lies Im tired of
The games I just want her back I know Im a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin leave again 
Ima tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
love the way you lie instrumentalRecovery vs. Thank Me Later InstrumentalsF-ck an intro man lets go.

I roll like a desperado now I never know where Im gonna go
Still I ball like theres no tomorrow
Until its over and thats all she wrote
Youre starin straight into a barrel of hate terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed wait Sarah youre late
Your train left mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over good bye ho I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut aint nothing to cry over
Never shouldve came within range of my Rover
Shouldve known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick whos dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up
She mistook me for some high roller well I wont buy her soda
Unless its Rock amp Rye Cola Faygos cheaper
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldnt let you eat the fuckin chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldnt die for ya
Trying to pull five bucks from me is like trying to pull five molars
Youll get your eyes swoll up Im on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch? youre already bi-polar!
Man TIP told me on this ho tip best tip I could give you to help you
Is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut shit
Dig you a hole? Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick its you but fuck ‘em TIP its cool
Im chilling like a villain like the penguin in its fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
Id rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie a fucking knot Id tie you in one bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
Ill give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you
So heres a penny for your thoughts
But it wont buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
Theres a bombshell scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfucking stud
Slut this will teach you not to come drunk stumbling my way for shizzle
I still live like I budget a Gilberts Lodge check stub bizzle
So fuck Sizzler these checkers are bust like a blood blister
Yeah I guess life is a bitch aint it TIP? And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldnt give you the dirt off my handkerchief
Im givin these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
Im sure you got that relationship memo by now but in case you didnt
Ill stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker that clock Im racin it
Double timin it but I still spit triple the amount
Of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-marts like theres an apostrophe S on it dog
And they say McDonalds isnt a restaurant well I guess Im wrong
But if you gonna tell me that AampW aint the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the F on dawg
All she wrote all she wrote
I said its over and thats all she wrote
All she wrote all she wrote

So why I gotta stop it this nigga was talkin
And I aint gotta prove you nothin
I do it and you aint gotta push my buttons
This dude in front of me he weighs a brick
Hes quick and I cant get Marshall hit
So I played my position and dont make a move
Been doin this for years my team cant lose
And aint nobody aint nobody hard
 oclock Im gonna punch me a guard
Hut one hut two Im ready
Hike give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this fore you have to kill me
And any player in my way Im foldin
Damn it call holton
Football Football I love football
Yes tres dos uno
Dos tres fuck shit bitch asshole son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle butthole
Freak who just tapped on my ass cheek
Nevermind lets try quarterback sneak
Cover me smother me with love thats brotherly
That didnt work try another play
Hut one hut two hut hut hurry up
Im reachin up another grown mans butt
Hike the ball I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus yikes I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard yeah so are my balls
Its the longest yard whoops thats not the Run it back wrong song yeah disreguard
That whole statement I just made what yard line we on?
On  and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left I just throw my ball
To the sideline to Von he steps outta bounds
 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle were down by six
The plan is to throw the ball to Swift
But hes so god dang high that hes trips
Falls and slips Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he dont get in but all we need is a put???
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit Ima slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybodys laughin now no timeouts and its now fourth now
Were never gonna make it wait I just got an idea
Quick everybody get naked Denaun go long
Ima throw the bomb cmon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on
Ass out with a floppin schlong touchdown yeah I told you
Its the longest yard
The new face on the yard just hand me the ball
Ima run through all of yall yall just soft
Even though my cleats is kickin up mud
Its more tragic for me Im stiff armin punks
High steppin through the end zone
I been grown Im so dirty you dont even know my skin tone
Its time to rumble no time to fumble
And I wont stumble your frontline will tumble
Playin ball with killas my teams the realest
Three time offenders even drug dealers
One of the best runnin backs there never was
Movin like Barry Sanders leavin you in the dust
Yack is high I got the highest yack
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snaps like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin my eye a Mack truck tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin backwards
Wide reciever recievin wide
For every stride in my life yo I breathe and die
Defense is playin a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams blue 
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excell
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare I gave the ball a stare
And use my linemans shoulder as a chair
Now Im flyin through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
Im no joke punk I get my dinerio
For bein the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut   hut
I do one run run the screen go run run
Then I cut spin around in the endzone touchdown!
Then I do the ninety shuffle so
Footballs
Im talkin about footballs dude
my ballAll Eyes On MeThis is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
Wasnt ready to be no millionaire I was illAnnotate-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
From the beginning it wasnt bout the ends
It was bout busting raps and standing for something fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like youre happy Im fucking back again
With another anthem why stop when it doesnt have to end?
It aint over til I say its over – enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
Im afraid of whatll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit I salivate at it
Raise your hands up like its  noon nah homie
Hold them bitches straighter up wave em til you dislocate a rotator cuff
I aint deflate enough last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
Im so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I dont got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
Im not a rapper Im an adapter I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floors open if youd like to discuss
Top  in this mothafucka and if I dont make the cut
What like I give a fuck Imma light this bitch up like Im driving a truck
To the side of a pump  to  hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen Im hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut
And I look like I might just give up eh you mightve mistook
Me for bowing out I aint taking a bow Im stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut while Im wiping my butt!
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut
Cause Imma fight til I die or win
Biting the dust itll just make me angrier wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
Its survival of what?
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
So get your ideas stack your ammo
But dont come unless you come to battle Im mad now jump in the saddle
This is it its what you eat sleep piss and shit
Live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit fuse is lit cant diffuse the wick
I dont do this music shit I lose my shit
Aint got shit to lose its the moment of truth
Its all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in the booth I spit
But my respect is overdue Im showing you the flow no one do
Cause I dont own no diploma for school I quit!
So theres nothing for me to fall back on I know no other trades
So youd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Cause youll never take my pride from me
Itll have to be pried from me so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me I dont want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you dont like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze but I just go atchoo then achieve!
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die

Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berserk
Guess its just the way that Im dressed aint it?
Khakis pressed Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it aint
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint

Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock baw wit da baw bang bang
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow

Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so now ho...
Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berserk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berserk all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berserk
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar oh sorry yo we done both set the bar low
Bars hard drugs hard thought thats the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I aint got no money to borrow
But I am tryin to find a way to get you alone car note!
Oh Marshall Mathers shouldnt everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered came ghost and called Arthurs Cargos
Girl youre fixin to get your heart broke dont be absurd man
You bird brained baby I aint called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless youre a swallow
Word w-word man you heard but dont be discouraged girl
This is your jam unless you got toe jam
Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berserk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berserk all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke

berzerk live at radio  The Marshall Mathers  Deluxe VersionSometimes you just feel tired feel weak
When you feel weak you feel like you just wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you try and find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation not to give up
And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.
Till I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em
Till the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
Cause when I am not then Im a stop pinnin em and
I am not hip-hop and Im just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when Im a stop sendin
em women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not
Get the illin to stop amoxacillins just not real enough
The criminal cop killin hip-hop villiana
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Your comin with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it
Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shockIs it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzin up?
Fa shizzel my wizzel this is the plot
Listen upYou bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck
Till the roof comes offTill the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
Im a rip this shit till my bones collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high perhaps?
Im a rip this shit till my bones collapse
Music is like magic theres a certain feelin
You get when youre real and you spit and people are feelin ya shit
This is your momentAnd every single minute you get tryn hold on to it
cause you may never get it again
So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over
Just admit when its at its end
Cause Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list
Heres the order of my list that its in -
It goes Reggie Jay-Z Tupac...
Where my thugs at
Huh increase the doses bustin whoever closest
Thug livin hell or prison never losin my focus
Im makin money moves manditory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin
Til the cops come runnin duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin my gun homeboy the motherfuckin villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry when the law come get me
No baby momma drama nigga miss me why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch waitin to trick me not the life for me
Livin carefree til Im buried - and if they dare me
Im bustin on niggaz until they scurry Im clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
From adolescence to my early teens thought we was gonna die
Sellin dope to all the fiends at times I wanna cry
And still we try to change the past in vain
Never knowin if this gamell last feelin ashamed
Of cocaine the product of the devil am I sellin my soul?
Got tired of small time livin niggaz tellin me no
I got MINE FUCK THEM OTHER SUCKERS thats the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz
I know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time
Well here it is nigga here it is
No insanity plea for me I ride the beef til I burn
Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn Im hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic before I smoke em like Sun Zu
Niggaz do unto these snitches before its done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin
And if I die by a slug the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? Gettin blowed out
High watch me murder the bird before he testify
Strikes walkin close to my third I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo eyes on the prize nigga watch for bustaz
Soon as a starts I eat at an MCs heart what is he thinkin
About to go against me? smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
Ill probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But Ill never be served my
Spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth
That would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could
Ever be worse thats why Im
Clever when I put together every
My thoughts are sporadic I act like
Im an addict
I rap like Im addicted to smackLike Im Kim Mathers
But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack Im launchin
At them the track is on some
Battlin rap who wants some static
Cause I dont really think that the fact that
Im Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if Im not the baddest
Until the roof Until the roof
The roof comes off The roof comes off
Until my legs Until my legs
Give out from underneath meI I will not fallI will stand tall
Feels like no one can
Beat me

berzerk dj shocker remixXtreme Cardio Mix Vol.   Min Non-Stop Workout Mix [- BPMYo if you could just for one minute
Or one split second in time forget everything
Everything that bothers you all your problems
Everything and follow me
If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand it passes through it
If I can grasp it and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through em to make you put your ass into it
And thats when you hit the roof because you cant sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it your movements become fast and fluent
Youre mashin to it moshing until youre black and bluish
Youre acting foolish this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True its chaotic but its got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight so make it last and you better just
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
Cause when we descend together we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync if youll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once I mean if you could let shit go
Relax take a breath and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make em feel the feeling that Im feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night wont end til I get finished
So close the shades makin sure no light gets in it
The skys the limit tonight because the nights infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like whats spinnin
His life was spinnin the whole entire night just spinnin
Like lifes beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin in it
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better

Dre just let it run
Hey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
...
Just shut up and listen Hey yo
Hey yo.
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this ... on this earth
And since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin these sentences gettin this stress
thats been eatin me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully peacefully...
But at least have the decency in you
...
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when Im eatin or feedin my daughter
To not come and speak to me speak to me... I dont know you
And no I dont owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
Im not Mr. NSync Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr. Friendly I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty...
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Im liftin you  feet  feet... in the air
I dont care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of arguin of arguin...
I dont mean to be mean but thats all I can be its just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant
And Oh its his lyrical content -
That song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me finger at me...
So I point one back at em but not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
When you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
With the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn on Marilyn... and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where its at
Middle America now its a tragedy
Now its so sad to see an upper class city
Havin this happenin this happenin...
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way rap this way...
But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and its burnin and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Im so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top on My Name Is
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rocknroll stations
And I just do not got the patience got the patience...
To deal with these cocky caucasians
who think Im some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk with an accent
And grab on my balls so they always keep askin
The same fuckin questions fuckin questions...
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in
The why the who what when the where and the how
Til Im grabbin my hair and Im tearin it out ahhh
Cause they drivin me crazy me crazy... I cant take it
Im racin Im pacin I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get
But I cant take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin by it
No I wont sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole Im glad
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?

He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do
I aint that mad thoiugh i just dont like bein lied to
Remeber when we met in Denver you said if I write to you you would write back

I never knew my father neither he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre sayin in your songs
So when i have a shty day i drift away and put em on
Cuz i aint really got st else so that st helps when im depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
Its like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real and I respect you cuz you tell it
My girlfriends jealous cause I talk about you 
But she dont know you like I know you Slim no one does
She dont know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man Ill be the biggest fan youll ever lose
Sincerely yours Stan -- P.S.

So this is my cassette Im sending you I hope you hear it
Im in the car right now Im doing  on the freeway
Hey Slim I drank a fifth of vodka dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air Tonight
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowninBut didnt then Phil saw it all then at that show he found him
Thats kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drownin
No its too late Im on a thousand downers now im drowsy
And all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know i ripped all of your pictures of the wall
I love you Slim we coulda been together think about it
You ruined it now I hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you cant sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you cant breathe without me
See Slim shut up b! Im trying to talk!
Hey Slim thats my girlfriend 
but I didnt I just tied her up see I aint like you
cause if she shell suffer more and then shell die too
Well gotta go Im almost at the bridge now
Oh st I forgot how am I supposed to send this st out?

You said your girlfriends pregnant now how far along is she?
Look Im really flattered you would call your daughter that

I seen this one st on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to
Come to think about his name was.. it was you

the way i am danny lohner remixThe Marshall Mathers LP.
So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isnt how I envisioned it
Famed to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shitd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me in to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a  then 
Years later theyd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint passed yet
A couple more years that shitll be ill-matic
And eight years later Im still at it
Divorce re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit it cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit it cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I got a letter from a fan that said
Hes been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
Its been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I dont read every
Letter I get but something told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they dont know you?
You didnt pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where Im at
Ive already told you at least
A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but Ive already got
God on my side
And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it?
Just watchin it from an opposite standpoint
Man boys got to look
Nuts
And thats the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit
So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit it cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit it cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
be carefulAll Eyes On MeIm about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor
To bring me back to life.
I told the World one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape lay it record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I dont even know if I believe it when Im saying that
Doubts start to creep in everyday is so gray and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for em
They just say its wack
They dont know what dope is
And I dont know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
It was you who picked me up breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
Before the life of me I dont see why you dont see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you its dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I dont think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon hug me
But Im out of options theres nothing else I can do cause…
Im about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor
To bring me back to life.
It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there pieces so Im puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you dont believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions not one you can form
Cant make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like youre begging for my help
Like Im your leader
Your supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more
I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU who believed in me
When everyone was telling you dont sign me
Everyone at the fucking label lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre Im crying in this booth
You saved my life now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I aint giving up faith and you aint giving up on me
Get up Dre Im dying I need you come back for fucks sake...
Im about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor
To bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life.
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in yellow jump suit
Whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth told you like smoke
Went through friends some of them I put on
But they just left they said was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them I dont see none of em
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath faggots
You gon see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little cracker jack beat making wack math
Backwards producers Im back bastards
One more CD and then Im packing up my bags and as Im leaving
Ill guarantee they scream Dre dont leave us like that man cause
Im about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im running out of time.
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor
To bring me back to life.
i need a doctorRemissionDetroit
There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You cant define it but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare Im from Detroit
You took our country from its infancy into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city like the sport is built on dreams
People who would drive to you driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork without sacrifice
When you hurt we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered of each factory closed
Weve lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit because we are you
My home
The home of Motown Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this we cannot be defeated because we have never been defeated
Youve built us youve moved us youve shaped us
Sometimes down but never out
Take strength in us your people
Stay up Detroit.
ode to detroit spoken wordThe Man Not the MythYeah look
If I woulda rap about the crap thats out thats the route
You probably want me to take cause youre just dying to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin about Paul Wall youd probably crap in your pants
Cause Im White and hes White so hes like my competition I mean right
Nope Paul Wall is dope and so is Bubba so b-b-b-b-b-b
But I dont compete with nobody
I just go hard do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents do donuts
Sometimes I play possum like Im asleep its awesome
Im like a sleepin giant and when I awake Im like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in em and fill em full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em
And let em know that I just dont feel em
And smack em with the backwards E on the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why look em dead in the eye then waste em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three that aint the hook now follow me
Theres nothing else for me to say my public adores me
Everybody bores me theyre just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers Come nearer
My darling I dont ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can youre my darling
Cause I possess your soul your mind your heart and your body
I dont ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can youre my darling
Cause I possess your soul your mind your heart and your body
Shady I know youre in there somewhere come here
Talk to me sit here pull up a chair
Why dont you cut your hair? Dye it back come on try it
Ahh no! I told you leave me the fuck alone will you?
But Im here to rebuild you But I already killed you!
But Shady we were meant for each other think about your mother
Yeah so what of her?

Were you the only white boy up in the bitch just rippin?
Pressing up your own flyers and your stickers stickin

Nowhere to run to run to now
Ive disappeared youll wonder how
Looking for me Im underground
Dre. Im down here under the ground
Pick me up broken tibias fibias yeah fix me up
 sluts all of them dying from asphyxia
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups toxins boxes of oxipads
Enough oxi-cotton to send a fucking ox to rehab
Whack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match He cant say that
Yes he can I just did faggot now guess again
Better text message your next of kin tell em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Throw a fucking lesbian into wet cement
Faggidy faggidy fagidy ragidy Ann and AndyNO! Ragidy Andy and Andy
NO! It cant be it cant be
Yes it can be the fucking Antichrist back Danny and Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville calamity god damn it insanity pills fanny pack filled with Xanax
Through every nook and cranny looking for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk
Negligee lookie
Razor blades with me to make you bleedCases of Maybelline make-up laying on the table of weed
Slim Shady shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out of the fucking toilet when youre taking a pee.
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ive disappeared youll wonder how
Looking for me Im underground
Six semen samples  strands of hair
Found at the back of a van after the shooting at the vanity fare
Hannah Montanna prepare to elope from a can opener and be cut open like a cantaloupe and canopy beds
Glad bags yeah glad to be back cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dead in rehab
Fucking doctor I didnt understand a damn what he said I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton I aint enlightened
Biting into a fucking Vicadin like Im a viking
Oh! Lightning is striking oh might be a fucking sign not like I need a psychic
Evaluation fuck Jason its Friday the th
That means its just a regular day and this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking lesbian shouldnt have had her legs in the way
Now shes pregnant and gay missing both legs and begging to stay.
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ive disappeared youll wonder how
Looking for me Im underground
Tell the critics Im back and coming to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of fonions
Mad at me understandable cannibal shoot an animal out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult!
Captain of a cult with an elite following to turn Halloween back into a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with s
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm street with a fucking wiffle bat drew fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissor Hands too
Came out with a little scratch ooh
Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity can it be vanity where is the humanity
And having a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
With a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Cut your fucking head off and ask you where youre headed off toGet it? Headed off to haha
Medic this headaches awful
This anesthetic is pathetic so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run to run to now
Ive disappeared youll wonder how
Looking for me Im underground

eminem got u slippinAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesIm friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake and eat it too and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew see it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery oh wee
But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meetIronic cause I think Im getting so huge I need a shrink
Im beginning to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But Im actually weirder than you think cause Im...
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well thats nothing
Well thats nothing
No I aint much of a poet but I know somebody
...
Once told me to seize the moment and dont squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be overtomorrow
So I keep conjuring sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah ponder it do you want this?
No wonder you losing your mind the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hooI
I think youve been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I loves killing me and I cant conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking nobodys home Im sleepwalking
Im just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Dont shoot the messenger Im just friends with the...
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well thats nothing
Well thats nothing
...
Call me crazy but I have this vision
...
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
And Im coming straight at MCs blood get spilled
And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at pumped up feeling
And shit to say back to the kids who play emI aint here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates thats great
Its payback Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something still can make that straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts I am nuts for real
But Im okay with that its nothing Im still friends with the...
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre trying to save me stop holding your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well thats nothing
...
Well thats nothing

eminem dope fiendAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesLook I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But Im only going to get this one chance
Six minutes six minutes
Somethings wrong I can feel it
Six minutes six minutes Slim Shady youre on
Just a feeling Ive got
Like somethings about to happen
But I dont know what
If that means what I think it means were in trouble
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
Im not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box?
They said I rap like a robot so call me rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My penll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinski feeling on his nutsack
Im an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic Kill em all with
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You dont really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappity-rap
Packing a mack in the back of the Ac
backpack rap crap yap-yap yackety-yack
and at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing that
Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Heres a Maxi-Pad
Its actually disastrously bad
For the wack while Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
Cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Immortality like I have got
Well to be truthful the blueprints
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
and did nothing but shoot for the moon since PPEEYOOM
MCs get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a New School full of students
Me? Me Im a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz Pac N-W-A. Cube hey Doc Ren
Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and being in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
Into the motherfuckin Rock n
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think its all a game
Til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
Youre witnessing a mass-occur like youre watching a church gathering
And take place looking boy
Oy vey that boys gay
Thats all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day looking boy
Hey looking boy what dyou say looking boy?
I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy
Imma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit
Git out my face looking boy
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy cause
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
The way Im racing around the track call me Nascar Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard
So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin
You rodent Im omnipotent
Let off then Im reloading
Immediately with these bombs Im totin
And I should not be woken
Im the walking dead
But Im just a talking head a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
Im out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common poodle
Im a Doberman pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage pupil
Its me
My honestys brutal
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said
On Im Back from the Mathers LP
One when I tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine
Put em all in a line
Add an AK- a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I aint as big as I was but Im
Morphin into an immortal coming through the portal
Youre stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
Youre pointless as Rapunzel
With fucking cornrows
You write normal fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabulous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Mayweathers pad singin to a man
While he play piano
Man oh man that was the  special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to radio station the very next day
Hey Fab Imma kill you
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed JJ Fad
Uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming Im a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman
Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is
Ricochet in off a me and itll glue to you
And Im devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
Never fading and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get em motivated
I make elevating music
You make elevator music
Oh hes too mainstream.
Well thats what they do
When they get jealous they confuse it
Its not hip hop its pop.
Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it
I dont know how to make songs like that
I dont know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While Im ripping any one of these verses that versus you
Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as niceyour songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Unghh school flunky pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
When Im a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But its still tongue-and-cheek fuck you
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
Im asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys
Still chunky but funky
But in my head theres something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and
Heres what they want from me
Theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Lifes handing you lemons
Make lemonade then
But if I cant batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Dont mistake him for Satan
Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Dont be a retard be a king?
Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?
eminem deja vuAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesAll aboard okay next stop my basement… ha ha
Ill meet you down there
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold Id go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum Id just laugh at him
Thats not happening that I cant fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide laterIm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Haters getting mad they done had enough of shady
You slay me nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
Thats a no-no who even she knows dadas fucking crazy
Fucking animal cookoo bananas fucking A B
Maybe its because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think its cause of the way that I was brought up
But its all caught up to me now karmas in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesnt creep upon ya but it all does
You wouldnt listen man I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought itd come to this I ought to just be honest but
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold Id go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum Id just laugh at him
Thats not happening that I cant fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide laterIm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Sorry Lance Mr. Lambert and Aiken aint gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots
Its all these fucking voices in my head I cant take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up fore I shake it
Youre standing adjacent to Jasons last slut theyre facing
Together makes em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient get the cops to mase him
Homie Im the sheisse pass Doctor Dre some
I cant leave the game I just cant walk away son
No not-a now not a chance not today son
I cant believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying check it
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold Id go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum Id just laugh at him
Thats not happening that I cant fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later Im living in a house with a fucking elevator
Elevator in my house Ill smell ya later
I blew the fuck up a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now steps I hate em
Told the neighbor step away then I just pepper sprayed em
Yeah for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker try countin sheep
And youre tryna find out why now theres beef?
Mase in your face bitch cry now pussy
This is my house all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouses teeth
Then I shove em in the elevator take em to the top
Stand above em just to cut the fucking cable let em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator get a pop
While I let em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre

And dr dre said...

Feminist women loved eminem
Chicka chicka chicka slim shady Im sick of him
Look at him walking around grabing his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who yea but hes so cute though
Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on tv and let looseBut cant but its cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
And if Im lucky u might just give it a little kiss
And thats the messege we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a womens vagina is
Of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit th gradeThey got the discovery channel dont they?
We aint nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals
Who rip other people open like canolopes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope ughh
But if you feel like I feel I got the antadoite
Women wave your pantyhose sing the And it gooooesss
refrain

So wont the real slim shady...
Please stand up please stand up please stand up
verse 
Will smith dont gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do so f--- him and f--- you too
You think I give a damn about a grammy?
Half of you critics cant even stomach me let alone stand me

Why? so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to britney spears
S--- christina aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to carson daily and fred durst
And hear them argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on mtv

And show the whole world how you gave eminem head scream
Im sick of you little golden boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I been sent in here to destroy you
And theres a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me
Who just dont give a f--- like me
Who dress like me
Walk talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing
But not quite me
refrain
verse 
Im like a headtrip to listen to
Cause Im only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of yall
And I dont got to be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
Wheather you like to admit it
Im better than % of you rappers out there
Then you wanna outkin kids like these albums like
Its funny cuz the rate Im going when Im 
Ill be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when Im hard jerkin Im jerking
But this whole bag of viagra isnt working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin
He could be workin at burger king spitten on your onion rings
Were in the parking lot circling
Screaming I dont give a f---
With his windows down and system up
So will the real shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up

And old men have heart attacks
And I dont wanna be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An eighty-three year old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Ugh!

But then again youd finally get your wish
Cause youll be all over the street like  Cent

And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck dick
In the industry swear that you in the streets hustlin
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin
And beggin motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you cant even get the clearances cause real lyricists
Dont even respect you or take you serious
Its not that we dont like you we hate you period
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn
Last week you was shaking Obie Trices hand
Now hes a buster? What the fucks with that
Get on a track dissing us and kissin s ass
And asking me what I know about indictments bite me
Bitch I got two cases and probation fight me!
What do I know about standing in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world?
A little girl and I put that on her when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I dont know shit about no shopping rocks
But what you know about hip hop shops rocking spots?
Were you the only white boy up in the bitch just rippin?
Pressing up your own flyers and your stickers stickin
Them bitches up after spending six hours at Kinkos
Just making copies of your covers to cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spending your whole paychecks at Disk Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh thats right you should know what thats like youre half white
Ha ha ha
Vanilla Ice spill the beans and rice
Im eating you alive inside Jesus Christ!
If youre that much of a gangsta put the mic down

Kill a motherfucker dead kill em dead bitch!
Shoot em in the fuckin head go ahead bitch!
Slap my mom slap the fuck out of her!
She cant sue you she wouldnt get a buck out of ya

Ha ha ha
Youll never have no security youll never be famous
Youll never know what its like to be rich lifes a bitch aint it?
Raymond? Here let me break the shit down in Laymens
Terms for you just to make sure that you can understand it
Since Canibus is using too many complicated fuckin words for you
Here let me slow it down for so you could understand if I say it slower
Let it go dogg its over
I dont wanna be like this
I dont really wanna hurt no feelings
But Im only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap
Uh ugh
And old men have heart attacks
And I dont wanna be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity
Ha ha talking bout I have motherfuckers calling your crib
Bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib!
You aint even got a fucking phone fucking bum
Threatenin to shut me down at ya lil fucking Source magazine
If I come back when did I attack you?
Bitch you attacked me first take it like a man
And shut the fuck up fuck your little magazine too
I dont need your little fucking magazine

And you got us scared up in that motherfucker?
Suck my motherfuckin dick
Oh! And for those that dont know
Dont get it twisted yall
The Source has a white owner!
eminem forever verseAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesYeah
Yeah girl
Can you hear that?
Its playing our song
Are you sleepy?
Take a nap
Youre not afraid of the dark are ya?
You hear the beat As it makes ya Not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakotas door Its locked so I go to creep
round the back with binoculars Not cause I want to peep
But because Im hungry She smells like tacos I want to eat
Visions of hot choclatey marshmallows Also sweet
With sugar plums Oh look here comes Marshall hes on your street
Hes placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on em Hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey A holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast With strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper Is all that I am
My music box
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
But i can hear u my love you keep calling me
I want the world to know you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come I will answer
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer
I almost look comatose Who wants to be sobered gross
I foam like a doberman mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mothers make up get naked and run around
Wavin the gun around I think Im down to a hundred pounds
Theres thunder I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out
I must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest but what do I do its locked
I pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts
I dig til I find it I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full I smell a funeral guess Ill loom in the park
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
But i can hear u my love you keep calling me
I want the world to know you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come I will answer
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer
Im fixated on asphyxating and breakin this little chicks
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin bitches get horse-whippinsIm in the back through the back door slip in
Through the crack leavin the corpse drippin
The mortition of love sent from aboveForced entry the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doin this for more than a quarter century Im just numb
Am I dreamin is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder
Id had enough of the chatter climb up to the window look at her
And climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that Ill have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back-to-back like Tabatha!
Im your secret admirer Im back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight but youre no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin her
Dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera
Stand back cuz here comes your man Jack so Pamela
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
But i can hear u my love you keep calling me
I want the world to know you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come I will answer
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer
eminem music boxAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesYea oh oh yea yea oh I feel like dancing I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air thats making me high
I said I smell something in the air thats making me high
OK here we go do-re-mi-fa-so fa so la-di-da so
Lyrical roscoe give back the tobasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tic tac so
Time to show you the most kick ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole
tic tac toe frozen six pack with exacto
Knives strangling wives with pig lasso
three bags of the the grass zig zags Im with the doc so
You know how that go skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home my little vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six pack sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
Its not what you expected nor what you thought so
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke
It must be the ganja
Its the marijuana thats creeping upon me while Im so high
Maybe its the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatevers got into me I dont mind
Your dreams are getting fulfilled oh Im literally getting the chills.
Spitting at will me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
Youre submitting to skill sitting still Im admitting Im beginning to feel
Like I dont think anyones realFaced with a dilemma I can be Dalai Lama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please dont upset me mama you looking sexy mamaDont know if this the lala or the rum and Pepsi mama
Dont want to end up inside my refrigerator freezerBe used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a rowPut em in chronological order beginning with Jack the RipperName the time and place from the body the bag the zipperLocation of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumpedThe trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate
And which motel which lake they found her inAnd how they attacked the victimSay which murder weapon was used to do what and which oneWhich knife and which gun what kid what wife and which nunDont stop I like this its fun the fucking nights just begun
It must be the ganja
Its the marijuana thats creeping upon me while Im so high
Maybe its the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatevers got into me I dont mind
When Im behind a mic dynamite is what its kinda like
Get stuck with that same stick that youre trying to light
Behind the boards is Dre legends are made this way
Isnt it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him someHe can give her some she can give him some
Get behind a lynn drum make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
Youre spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance Im
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Capable of bringing a bullets a still unbelievable bullets a Titanium cranium thats full of surprises
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos eyes
Good evening this isnt even a weed thingI aint even smoke anything I aint even drinking
It must be the ganja
Its the marijuana thats creeping upon me while Im so high
Maybe its the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatevers got into me I dont mind
eminem be carefulAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesOh oh oh oh oh ooh
There is no escaping...
Theres no place to hide...
You scream Someone save me
But they dont pay you no mind...
Goodbye!
Youre walkin down a horror corridor
Its almost  in the morning and youre in a
Nightmare its horrible
Right theres the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
Youre a goner hes onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea he just saw you run
All you want is to rest cuz you cant run anymore youre done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party applauding it
Here I sit while Im caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing a klonopin while Im noddin in and out on the ottoman
At the ramada inn holdin on to the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonalds with
Blood all over me Dead bodies behind the counter shit
Guess I must have just blacked out again...
Not again!
Its  A.M. in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
but I guess I musta killed em killed em
I said...
Its  A.M. in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
but I guess I musta killed em killed em
Sitting nude in my living room its almost noon
I wonder whats on the tube maybe theyll show some boobs
Surfin every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the Aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin every candle
On top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin in my front window if you look in
Im just a hooligan whos used to usin hallucinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruisin the skin
Razors scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end?
Phases that I go through
Dazed and Im so confused
Cheesed that I dont know who
Gave these molecules to
me what am I gon do?
Heed the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them
Its  A.M. in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
but I guess I musta killed em killed em
I said...
Its  A.M. in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
but I guess I musta killed em killed em
She puts the lotion in the bucket it puts the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket it puts the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again
I choke and I slash sliced and gassed
Last night was a blast
I cant quite remember when I had that
Much fun of a half pint of a jack
My last spike and a half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashians ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December I think it was I was havin drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink this bath water that oughta be fun
Thats when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just dont seem to bother me none
Its  A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here man theres gotta be one
Oh no theres probably none he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs but aint no stoppin me from choppin him up... up
Cuz its...
 A.M. in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all over the floor and
I dont remember how they got there
but I guess I musta killed em killed em
I said...
Its  A.M. in the mornin
Put my key in the door and

But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten

I been gone Im so dirty you dont even know my skin tone
Its time to rumble no time to fumble
And I wont stumble your frontline will tumble
Playin ball with killas my teams gorillas
Three time offenders even drug dealers
One of the best runnin backs there never was
Movin like Barry Sanders leavin you in the dust
Yack is high I got the highest yack
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snaps like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin my eye a Mack Truck tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin backwards
Wide reciever recievin wide
For every stride in my life I breathe and die
Defense is playin a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excell
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare I gave the ball a stare
And use my linemans shoulder as a chair
Now Im flyin through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
Im no joke punk I get my dinerio
For bein the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut   hut
I do one run run the screen go run run
Then I cut spin around in the endzone
Then I do the ninety shuffle so
Footballs
Im talkin about footballs dude
eminem my ballAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesLook I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But Im only going to get this one chance
Six minutes six minutes
Somethings wrong I can feel it
Six minutes six minutes Slim Shady youre on
Just a feeling Ive got
Like somethings about to happen
But I dont know what
If that means what I think it means were in trouble
Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say
Im not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box?
They said I rap like a robot so call me rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My penll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinski feeling on his nutsack
Im an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic Kill em all with
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You dont really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappity-rap
Packing a mack in the back of the Ac
backpack rap crap yap-yap yackety-yack
and at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing that
Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Heres a Maxi-Pad
Its actually disastrously bad
For the wack while Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
Cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap
Immortality like I have got
Well to be truthful the blueprints
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
and did nothing but shoot for the moon since PPEEYOOM
MCs get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a New School full of students
Me? Me Im a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz Pac N-W-A. Cube hey Doc Ren
Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and being in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them
Into the motherfuckin Rock n
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think its all a game
Til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
Youre witnessing a mass-occur like youre watching a church gathering
And take place looking boy
Oy vey that boys gay
Thats all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day looking boy
Hey looking boy what dyou say looking boy?
I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy
Imma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit
Git out my face looking boy
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy cause
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
The way Im racing around the track call me Nascar Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard
So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin
You rodent Im omnipotent
Let off then Im reloading
Immediately with these bombs Im totin
And I should not be woken
Im the walking dead
But Im just a talking head a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
Im out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common poodle
Im a Doberman pinch yourself
In the arm and pay homage pupil
Its me
My honestys brutal
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize
What I do though for good
At least once in a while so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes
But sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to
Censor you like that one line I said
On Im Back from the Mathers LP
One when I tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine
Put em all in a line
Add an AK- a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I aint as big as I was but Im
Morphin into an immortal coming through the portal
Youre stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
Youre pointless as Rapunzel
With fucking cornrows
You write normal fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabulous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Mayweathers pad singin to a man
While he play piano
Man oh man that was the  special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to radio station the very next day
Hey Fab Imma kill you
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed JJ Fad
Uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming Im a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman
Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is
Ricochet in off a me and itll glue to you
And Im devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
Never fading and I know that haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get em motivated
I make elevating music
You make elevator music
Oh hes too mainstream.
Well thats what they do
When they get jealous they confuse it
Its not hip hop its pop.
Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it
I dont know how to make songs like that
I dont know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While Im ripping any one of these verses that versus you
Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as niceyour songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Unghh school flunky pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
When Im a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But its still tongue-and-cheek fuck you
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
Im asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys
Still chunky but funky
But in my head theres something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and
Heres what they want from me
Theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Lifes handing you lemons
Make lemonade then
But if I cant batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Dont mistake him for Satan
Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Dont be a retard be a king?
Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?
eminem respect meAll Eyes on Me The Eminem FilesThis motherfucker man! Just wont shut up will you?
Talking bout I owe him bitch you owe me
Im promoting you right now
Yo lets put the nail in his coffin
I dont wanna be like this
I dont really wanna hurt no feelings
But Im only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap
Nope
And old men have heart attacks
And I dont wanna be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An eighty-three year old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Ugh!
Please dont youll probably fall with me
And our assesll both be history
But then again youd finally get your wish
Cause youll be all over the street like  Cent
Ha ha ha

Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryderz and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck dick

You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin
And beggin motherfuckers for guest appearances

Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world?
A little girl and I put that on her when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I dont know shit about no shopping rocks
But what you know about hip hop shops rocking spots?
Were you the only white boy up in the bitch just rippin?
Pressing up your own flyers and your stickers stickin

Just making copies of your covers to cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer

Got em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell em stick it
So sick Im looking pale well thats my pigment
Bout to go ham ya bish shout out to Kendrick
Lets bring it back to that vintage Slim bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I dont mean Stimpys friend bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym bitch
Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berzerk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berzerk all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berzerk shake your body
Guess its just the way that Im dressed aint it?
Khakis pressed Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it aint
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game check mate
But girl your bodys banging jump me in gang bang bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kids rock baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Catch a cab I wanna go down b-b-bow bow
Slow it down throw in the towel t-t-towel tow
Dumb it down I dont know how huh-huh how-how
At least I know that I dont know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so now ho
Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berzerk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berzerk all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berzerk get your vials
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar oh sorry yo we done both set the bar low
Bars hard drugs hard thought thats the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I aint got no money to borrow
But I am tryin to find a way to get you alone car note!
Oh Marshall Mathers shouldnt everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered kangols and Carhartt these Cargos
Girl youre fixin to get your heart broke dont be absurd man
You bird brained baby I aint called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless youre a swallow
Word w-word man you heard but dont be discouraged girl
This is your jam unless you got toe jam
Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berzerk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berzerk all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berzerk get your vials
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berzerk get your vials
berzerk workout mix by chani Top Hits Workout Mixes Volume Welcome to Detroit
This is the BET Shady . Cypher 
Myself Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf
White Dawg get em
Put these muthafuckas in a box and I send em away
Put em in a gray llac and pop the trunk
And throw em in the back jack ha dig em a grave
Put a brick inside that Xerox when I print up a page
Moving keys I can relate cause I live in the cage
I throw up the A I take em to school
I give them a grade
An easy E for effort thats WWA
White with an attitude
Alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is Zs they sleeping on me
I cant get em awake
I spoon feed em a sound
In a room full of deceivers and clowns
Who believe in making it rain cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the VIP like a potato
With a bunch of meatheads like fuck it
Ill just feed em a cow
Plenty of White boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper you better pick up your heater
Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic
But what its like to pick a fight with me
Is like putting Nikes on a cheetah better speed up
Or at least in my case Adidas
Im out this bitch drinking Sprite by the two-liter
Holler
Shady Records
Say Im from the new school Imma say check your tone and watch your mouth
If they teaching how to Dougie Im condoning dropping out
Forced to wild yall birthed me then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hops foster child now check it
Dont blame yall for being trash fans are copping it
The radios the crime scene the masses are the hostages
In my youth Id throw shots the fad was dodging it
Im grown I aint watching the throne Im sabotaging it
You see that four-headed monster in the storm looms
Snipe em from a distance the scope got a long zoom
You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure here you wont get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me Id revive what the game be bout
Id ve took the wine outta Amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats bout cockin a snub back
Wayne couldnt teach me how to love that
But I got this chick from uptown she my summer bunny
Both parents broke but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out and now she doubt David is Stern
Shes so bad I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the Holiday Inn learned that from Max B
Thats why the haters envy kinda wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes like I was Benihanas
Is it me or is what Im hearing just pitiful
Airwaves the same now the stereos typical
My skins thick so the critics ignored
So unafraid to die youd think I did it before
The boys Rodman with the trash talk
Magic or Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
Glass jaw Hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no passport
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trapdoors
If punks had award you status whores categore
Probably be that of awards between Michael Rappaport and Kenny Latimore
I know hip-hops alive and well
If it died you other crews wouldnt survive the smell
I spot a victim the plotll thicken when the clock is ticking
I caught him slipping I gotta give him a shot
I hit him with proper spitting hottest writtens and compositions
So competitions a contradiction somebody mention they got a Crooked
Highly fiction we probably different got Gotti henchmen
Opposition Ill body quick as Bugatti engines
Im on a mission to get richer the sickest lyric-kicker
Digging a ditch for different spitters
Weak lyricists get disfigured
Sip liquor spit like a sick mixture
Of Notorious Pun and L get the big picture
The poster Ill roast ya
My mind so deadly its just like the beanie is close to a holster
Its over control my whole coastal region
Like Im supposed to flow is going postal even
Open season heart close to freezing
Ruthless as Eazy nigga approach Im squeezing believe me
Dopest Westcoaster breathing so most ya hope Im vegan
Nope Im beefing rappers need to keep it trill
Give me a beat to kill
Too many people still eating sleeping pills
People sleeping on my ether skills
And yall aint even real you bout to die in this cypher
Before you die you should do the Jada and leave a Will
I aint a rap dude Im a dude who rap
Before this I was moving crack
Killers yall become when yall rhyme I salute and dap
And if I blink theyll remove your snaps
You aint cool you wack with your foolish act
Skinny jeans dont mean your ass shoot it means your booty claps
Dont play like Tyler Perry
This the Slaughterhouse of pain
Flow brown tight and heavy
When it come to s Im a fiend
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writing bars to Nas Thiefs Theme getting my Yaowa on
Man all these Olajuwons we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They fiending for us to break like Beyonces water
The four quarters doing all the eating
And yall gotta know why I made the cut Im Puerto Rican
Ortiz keep the fire ready
And tryna put me outs like tryna steal a transvestite from Eddie
Im do or die dope and you can make the sticker sitting
On the door of that Phantom your suicide note
Hi Rihanna... is Nicki living with you
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi Rihanna... I dont need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again we go together
Bye Rihanna... now back to yall fools
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames I prefer to see the world through
Dont ask me nothing bout Budden I beat my girl too
You ask me why do I keep her I say its cheaper to
Thats why I ride around in a Rolls like Wiz Khalifa do
Rappers Im your daddy I tell you straight as this
You dont kill but your father will like Jayden Smith
I tell you like I tell my Spanish chick
You fly but I aint going down on no landing strip
So get your wax on like Daniel San
Or Imma have to run like De la Hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive I head shot em
Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While Im cyber-sexing with Jessica Alba via Skype
Im on my D-boy Deebo thing
Spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with yo B Roll bling
You know your flow is wack
We cornered the market like a Wal-Mart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah this is what two million singles sold and an album thats gold
Look like without having to sell your soul
Ayo lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal
Subliminal in your swimming pool
Youre about to see peace destroyed itll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your CD stores
Wanna stop it you gon need a priest at least three swords
A license to ill from the Beastie Boys three Ouija boards
A squeegee and please be warned dont ask what the squeegees for
Or the holy water acid raps thatll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book you see these horns
And as for me you ask when Im gone will he be mourned
.is puke luke warm should Casey Anthony do porn
Can that chick fit a new born dead baby inside a fricking shoebox
With a shoehorn
Smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on
Can she duct tape and Velcro a fetus
Joell yo tell Joe I need his
Empty box from his old shell toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in the fetal position
Theyre getting elbows to the penis
Yeah big deal
I took some little kids Big Wheel and spit in his frickin big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch you wench sit still
Did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz windshield
Is it dust we bout to kick up
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his frigging pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will til he gets hicc-ups
Flipping the script up like Mike Vick
Getting bit in his junk by a Pit yup Im a sick pup
Id be a horrible magician cause Ill fuck a trick up
Fix your lips up to say something fly or zip up
A B lets C you said you were gonna do X-Y-Z
Til you fuck around and get dropped like an E when you add an I-N-G
Dont put a K in front of that though when I MC
Cause Im not the king of this microphone booth
Its more like a phone booth
Superman in this bitch Kryptonite wont do
It gives me more power I bump the Fat Boys and
Eat rat poison take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossing a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pitll
Be like Nas doing gospel or RampB you crazy
Me pushing up daisies that thought is impossible
As if flashing across the news
Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson boobs and a monstrous tube of lube
And a bra some boots some panties and an aqua blue Mazda
Swallowing a popsicle playing tonsil pool
So kill the rumors it aint happening
Imma rap til Im fossil fuel
bet shady   cypherCompilationIf I die young bury in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
If I die young bury in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
She got that good good she Michael Jackson bad
Im attracted to her for her attractive ass
And now were murderers because we kill the time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day hot as a summers eve
Young money thieves steal your love with ease
I like the way you walk and if youre walking my way
Im that red bull now lets fly away
Lets buy a place with all kind of space
I let you be the judge n n and Im the case
Im Gudda Gudda I put her under
I see me with her no Stevie Wonder
She dont even wonder cause she know she bad
And I got her nigga grocery bag
If I die young bury in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Man if I could sing. Id keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes Id blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her how proud I am that I got her
God Im a daddy Im so glad that her mom didnt...
Now you probably get this picture from mu public persona
That Im a pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cause theres a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside my soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breaking
Should I just give up or live up to these excpetations?
Now look I love my daughter more than life itself
But I got a wife thats determined to make my life living hell
But I handle it ell given the circmustances Im dealt
So many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else
But the years that Ive wasted is nothing to the tears that Ive tasted
So heres what Im faceing  felonies  years of probation
Ive went to jail for this woman Ive been to bat for this woman
Ive taken bats to peoples back bent over backwards for this woman
If I die young bury in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
if i die youngCompilationI stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
Im pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
Thats what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
Im a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just
stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed em
Defiance giant scrotum
He dont owe them bitches shit
His bridges he out growd em
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breath whenever you gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
Im back for revenge
I lost a battle that aint happening again
Im at your throat like strep
I step strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my handSomeone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops any who touch a mic priors
Not even Austin Powers how the fuck are they
Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-
Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dicks too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm you
prick
You call me the champ call me the space
shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger matter fact I need
a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in
his corner like burn choyder
Youre the Eminem backwards youre mini-me
See hes in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BBs you beat back bullets
Youre full of it you were just in his CDs
Left at Infinite now hes back like someone
pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties hes turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EPs got the attention of the
mighty D. R. E
Im haunted Im dead your gone
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breath whenever you gone
Cant go back Im haunted
Oooooh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time

Trying but slowly
It feels like Im fallin now I cant hold my ground

Ha now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Aint even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
Im like...
Jimmy can crack corn but I dont care
My enemies crack corn but I dont care
You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I dont like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just dont say it and I wont say it
See if you dont brag then I dont brag
I know Im bad as long as I know Im bad
I dont need yall to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but dont dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast

Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight
Im getting mad love Im snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs smuggling drugs juggling jobs guzzling jugs
So heres a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex unaffordable medical debts huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet I carried on my back
Butterfingers is here and its necessary to scratch it
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight Im dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

We dont wanna fight we dont want no one feeling uptight

We dont wanna fight we dont want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyones feeling alright
Ayo biters are like tarantulas vandealous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this Im the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldnt see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black guarded your back
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
Im forever demented come up with funk Ill never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly said it

Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece
of plywood
Ive got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis cause you dont posses the pizzazz as this
Im hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
Im cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that Im cynical
Theres no one whos identical to my fresh and authentic flow
Im sure the party people can agree
That Im enchanting with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here just be like

You gotta do something about that
You talking about me like you fucking know me manlike Its funny man I go to sleep and I laugh at it
Dont even bother me no more
Yeah like listen
Its times like these when I feel regret
When I gotta work for this worthless cheque that dont pay for shit
I never finished school what do you expect? Me to be cool?
Yes? No?
I dont think so
Well back in school they tell me
What if I start drowning are you gonna to be there to bail me?
I dont think so
So please save the talk for someone else
I feel like I should have been someone else
But damn Im not Im stuck in this hell spot
I fail to prevail so let my ass rot
I wish I was an abortion but Im afraid not
A portion of my life is Im happy Im here
The rest is a blank spot
I think everything is going to be okay.
Yeah I think not!
I hate my life I bet you hate yours too
But whats the reason for being this motherfucking miserable?
People tell you to be positive how do you take that
When shit around you is negative and cant catch a break jack
Why do I feel this way
I say why do I feel this way
See I got too much weight on my shoulder blades
How much more weight can I take
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?
Man Im sick and tired of all this shit

They just pissed at you man theyre just mad youre doing shit better than them
I swear you dope fuck what they think
They can all suck a dick suckers die they all fucking stink
Theyre shit shit dont take it personal this is the world we live in shit stays in urinals
Complex self esteem issues so they diss you to up themselves and make themselves feel special
Understand youre up there up where? up here nobody can touch you
Motherfucker youre nuts yeahyou are not a quitter
you are sicker
than most of these little skanks so stop feeling bitter
about yourself
You know these suckers – youre much bigger
You function on a different level youre something like a ton bigger
Your tongue is fungus your skill is humongous
You know it so fuck it dont listen to these dumb kids
Why do I feel this way
I say why do I feel this way
See I got too much weight on my shoulder blades
How much more weight can I take
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?

The world is a cold ass place man you cant quit
If you quit you might as well call yourself dead
You know what Im saying?
So keep moving dont take shit personal
Dont let it get to you
Dont let them get the best of you man
I look toward my goal so I move forward I know
If I stop now Im proven that Im no good and these haters win
I wont let that happen again Im a fighter a lighter bitch
Imma fight till I retireI took a breath to rewired my wires
Im Robocop back from the dead
The show dont stop till I roll over rot
I know that Im hot I dont need people to tell me that
Not even school to hold me back and tell me that Im a failure
Ill nail your coffin soft in your hard image
Im starving and it is kinda crazy how I keep eating
Without taking a break and drinking a shake in between
Breast that I barely take or some water to wash down
This awful taste I wonder if anyone out there can relate
Man Im losing any grasp I have on my fate
Cause Im so rough soon no record deal on my plate
Half of those fuckers cant even see me
The other half wanna be me
The ones that dont know me dont know that Im killing beats easy
Man Im mad I cant understand it
Tell the planet to kiss my ass and
Grab a sweater and cram it damn it
Why do I feel this way
I say why do I feel this way
See I got too much weight on my shoulder blades
How much more weight can I take
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?
How could you be so cold huhh huhh?
Man Im sick and tired of all this shit
How could you be so cold

I know sometimes
Things may not... always make sense to you right now
But hey whatd daddy always tell you?
Straiten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about?
You got me
Hailie I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad
When Im gone
But Im tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see you sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside you wanna cry
Cuz youre scared
I aint there? Daddys with you in your prayers
No more cryin wipe them tears
Daddys here no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it
We gon do it
Laynee uncles crazy aint he
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
World we got in this world
When it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze
I know its confusin you
Daddys always on the move mommys always in the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I dont see us ever being together
Ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But its just something we have no control over
And thats what destiny is
Well no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and thisll all just be a dream
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up
Little lady I told ya
Daddys gonna hold ya
Through the night
I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy
Pretty baby
But I promise mommas gonna be alright
Its funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree
And said some of em were from me
Cuz daddy couldnt buy em
Ill never forget that christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin
Cuz daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time
Every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so that you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
And it seemed like everything was starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin alot so momma moved back on the traumas on a falt
One bedroom appartment
And dad moved back to the other side of  mile on Navara
And thats when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work
You and momma had to leave me
Then you started to see me on the TV
And momma didnt like it
And you an Laynee were too young to understand it
Pappa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit
And it all happened to fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was make you proud
Now Im sittin in this empty house
Just reminising lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown its almost like your sisters now
Wow guess you pretty mucn are
And daddys still here
Laynee Im talking to you too
Daddys still here
I like the sound of that cheer
Its got a ring to it don it
Shh... mommas only gone for the moment
And if you ask me too daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
Im gon give you the world
Im gon buy a diamond ring for you
Imma sing for you
Ill do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
Imma break that birdys neck
I go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make em eat every carat dont fuck with dad

Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Scream one last time
Get your ass up for the doctor one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor come on now
Here we go cliff hanger its another club banger
Got you hanging on the edge of your seat get on down
Times up games over you lose I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah new year next phase begin
Look whos got you going crazy again
Im a trend I set one every time Im in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad that means your something that we already had
But once youre gone you dont come back too bad
Youre off the map now radar cant even find you
We stay on the grind you slip we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playing the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissing and moaning whining and bitching
Sit and observe listen youll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later three diamond
Worldwide were on the charts with a bullet and still climbing
First we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cuz i dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Swing one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk you will get it crunk
Get it crunk crunk crunk crunk
And when  Cent says jump you get on one foot and jump
Jump jump jump jump
The buzz is tremendous we drop you all to sense it
I dont gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rocking off the hinges
We aint showing off we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up knock it off who the fuck is Doc impressing?
Doc is this Doc is that you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc cause Doc left you all guessing
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record What?
We gon have this mutherfucker hopping in a second Bump bump
Thats why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cause we done swam with the sharks wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages broke down barriers
Of language and races just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the back
And forth all day like the hot potato game thats why we came to
First we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cuz i dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Swing one last time
 Cent come on!
Bounce now hands up you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
Its no secret everybody know
When Dres involved theres plenty money involved
And plenty honeys involved the sunny Sundays
And palm trees Cali every day its just another party
From the valleys all the way to them  Mile alleys
Lets rally hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio banging out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speaker
So never say never cause ShadyAftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the. the Doc and Shady
No one could do it better we tear the club up
And leave without a shred of evidence and uh
First we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cuz i dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Yeah still Aftermath 
And dont worry bout that Detox album

HAHA!
 Cent G-Unit Obie Trice D-Twizzy Stat Quo Dr. Dre

Ladies and gentlemen thank you all for coming out peace!
encore editMockingbirdOkay Im going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check one two we recording?
Im cancerous so when I diss you wouldnt want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangle you to death then I choke you again
And break your fucking legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me Imma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
So if I said I never did drugs that would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt and lately Im on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed take pills drop out of school kill people and drink
Jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
Im dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So Im dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that Im white ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I dont get pissed yall dont even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white?
I dont even exist
I get a clean shave bathe go to a rave die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger wont go down how do I wave?
And this is how Im supposed to teach kids how to behave?
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Dont you want to grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms then OD
Now dont you want to grow up to be just like me?
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door must have been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
Killed them both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
My mind wont work if my spine dont jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
Im not a player just a ill rhyme sayer thatll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap styles warped
Im running out the morgue with your dead grandmothers corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
Im about as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there?
I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone please explain to my brain that I just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and Im in pain?
I take a breather and sigh either Im high or Im nuts
Cause if you aint tilting this room neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit its over with
I bought Cages tape opened it and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Dont you want to grow up to be just like me?
Ive been with  women who got HIV
Now dont you want to grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Dont you want to grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably want to grow up to be just like me
role model radio editRole Model  Cum on Everybody   Bonnie amp ClydeThis motherfucker man! Just wont shut up will you?

But Im only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap
Nope
And old men have heart attacks
And I dont wanna be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An eighty-three year old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Ugh!
Please dont youll probably fall with me
And our assesll both be history
But then again youd finally get your wish
Cause youll be all over the street like  Cent

You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin
And beggin motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you cant even get the clearances cause real lyricists
Dont even respect you or take you serious
Its not that we dont like you we hate you period
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn
Last week you was shaking Obie Trices hand

Get on a track dissing us and kissin s ass
And asking me what I know about indictments bite me
Bitch I got two cases and probation fight me!
What do I know about standing in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world?
A little girl and I put that on her when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I dont know shit about no shopping rocks
But what you know about hip hop shops rocking spots?
Were you the only white boy up in the bitch just rippin?
Pressing up your own flyers and your stickers stickin
Them bitches up after spending six hours at Kinkos
Just making copies of your covers to cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spending your whole paychecks at Disk Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh thats right you should know what thats like youre half white
Ha ha ha
Vanilla Ice spill the beans and rice

Youll never know what its like to be rich lifes a bitch aint it?
Raymond? Here let me break the shit down in Laymens
Terms for you just to make sure that you can understand it

I dont wanna be like this
I dont really wanna hurt no feelings
But Im only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap

we made you cleanWe Made YouThese ideas are nightmares for white parentswhose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearingits so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walking around with his headphones blaringalone in his own zone cold and he dont care
Hes a problem child and what bothers him all comes outwhen he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out
cuz he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out.
If he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked hes mad so hes talkin backtalkin black brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants do-rags and a stocking caphis step-father hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home.
Theres no control he just lets his emotions go...
Cmon! Sing with me Sing!
Sing for the year Sing It
Sing for the laughter
sing for the tear Cmon!
Sing it with me
Just for today
Maybe tomorrow
The good Lord will take you away...
Entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangstasin the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie only this gunlonely cuz dont anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relateI guess words are a mothafucka they can be great
or they can degrate or even worse they can teach hate
Its like these kids hang on every single statement we makelike they worship us
plus all the stores ship us platinumnow how the Fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune no more kissin ass
But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn youfans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you havethey want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon.
Any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict mestrictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin to me religiouslyso Im signin CDs while police fingerprint me
Theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me.
If Im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense B
Its all political if my music is literaland Im a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldnt. I wouldnt be fit to. Youre full of shit tooGuerrera that was a fist that hit you!
They say music can alter moods and talk to youwell can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can then the next time you assault a dudejust tell the judge it was my fault and Ill get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cuz they think the shits cool
not knowin we really just protectin ourselveswe entertainers of course the shits affectin our sales you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self we just explain itand then we get our checks in the mail. Its fucked up aint it?
How we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
Thats why we sing for these kidswho dont have a thing except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day longidolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone whos ever been through shit in their livestill they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe.
Were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes
thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own itsqueeze it and hold it cuz we consider these minutes golden
and maybe theyll admit it when were gone.
Just let our spirits live onthrough our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

Cause Mamas got a new husband and a stepson
And you dont want a brother do ya?
Maybe when youre old enough to understand a little better Ill explain it to ya

  bonnie clyde club editRole Model  Cum on Everybody   Bonnie amp ClydeYeah haha whoo shit
Yo mic check testing one two um. twelve
Whattup whattup whattup! Outsidaz
This is my dance song can you hear me?
Rah Digga Pacewon Young Zee
Alright ay turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobains head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hills tape so her kids could starve
I cant stand white people
You thought I was ill and now Im even more so
Shit I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
Im in the fourth row signin autographs at your show
I just remembered that Im absent-minded
Wait I mean Ive lost my mind I cant find it
Im freestylin every verse that I spit
Cause I dont even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here bitch just sniff this!
Cum on everybody get down tonight
I tried suicide once and Ill try it again
Thats why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I dont give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin it at everybody screaming I suck I suck!
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud All yall get the hell out now
Fuck rap Im givin it up yall Im sorry
But Eminem this is your record release party
Im bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess Im just a sick sick bastard
Whos one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
Ill probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that Im a mothafuckin Beastie Boy
So I told em I was Mike D
They was like gee I dont know he might be!
I told em meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
Ill be standin by the Loch Ness Monster
Peace out then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect brrrrrrring click

This is my dance song can you hear me?
Rah Digga Pacewon Young Zee
Alright ay turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobains head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hills tape so her kids could starve
I cant stand white people
You thought I was ill and now Im even more so
Shit I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
Im in the fourth row signin autographs at your show
I just remembered that Im absent-minded
Wait I mean Ive lost my mind I cant find it
Im freestylin every verse that I spit
Cause I dont even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here bitch just sniff this!
Cum on everybody get down tonight
I tried suicide once and Ill try it again
Thats why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I dont give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin it at everybody screaming I suck I suck!
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud All yall get the hell out now
Fuck rap Im givin it up yall Im sorry
But Eminem this is your record release party
Im bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess Im just a sick sick bastard
Whos one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
Ill probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that Im a mothafuckin Beastie Boy
So I told em I was Mike D
They was like gee I dont know he might be!
I told em meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
Ill be standin by the Loch Ness Monster
Peace out then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect brrrrrrring click
Its Ken Kaniff from Connecticut can you accept?

So just remember when I bomb your set

cum on everybody club editRole Model  Cum on Everybody   Bonnie amp ClydeYeah...
Its my life...
In my own words I guess...
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for?
Not the expression
No literally give an arm for
When they know theyre your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
What happens when you become the main source of pain
Daddy look what I made
Dads gotta go catch a plane
Daddy wheres mommy?
I cant find mommy where is she?
I dont know go play Hailie baby your Daddys busy
Daddys writin a song the song aint gon write itself
Ill give you one underdog then you got to swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother whos a spittin image of her
Thats Slim Shady
Yeah baby Slim Shadys crazy
Shady made me but tonight Shadys rock-a-bye-baby huh...
And when Im gone just carry on
Dont mourn rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im lookin down on you smilin
And I didnt feel a thing so baby
Dont feel no pain just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on
Dont mourn rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im lookin down on you smilin
And I didnt feel a thing so baby
Dont feel no pain just smile back
I keep havin this dream
Im pushin Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin she dont want me to sing
Youre makin mommy cry
Why? Why is mommy cryin?
Baby daddy aint leavin no more
Daddy youre lyin
You always say that you always say this is the last time
But you aint leavin no more Daddy youre mine
Shes pilin boxes in front of the door tryin to block it
Daddy please daddy dont leave daddy no stop it
Goes in her pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket its got her picture
Thisll keep you safe daddy take it with ya
I look up its just me standin in the mirror
These fuckin walls must be talkin cause man I can hear em
Theyre sayin you got one more chance to do right and its tonight
Now go out there and show em that you love em fore its too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door it turns to a stage
Theyre gone and the spotlight is on and Im singin
And when Im gone just carry on
Dont mourn rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im lookin down on you smilin
And I didnt feel a thing so baby
Dont feel no pain just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on
Dont mourn rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im lookin down on you smilin
And I didnt feel a thing so baby
Dont feel no pain just smile back
Sixty thousand people all jumpin out their seats
The curtain closes theyre throwin roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for comin out
Theyre screamin so loud Ill take one last look at the crowd
I glance down I dont believe what Im seein
Daddy its me help mommy her wrists are bleedin
But baby were in Sweden how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you daddy you told me that you werent leavin
You lied to me dad and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin it says Number One Dad
Thats all I wanted I just want to give you this coin
I get the point fine me and mommy are goin
But baby wait!
Its too late dad you made the choice
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
Thats what they want they want you Marshall they keep
Screamin your name its no wonder you cant go to sleep
Just take another pill yeah I bet that you will
You rap about it
Yeah word k-k-keep it real
I hear applause all this time I couldnt see How could it be that the curtain is closin on me?
I turn around find a gun on the ground cock itPut it to my brain scream Die Shady! and pop it
The sky darkens my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes And burns to ashes
Thats when I wake up alarm clocks ringin
Theres birds singin
Its spring and Hailies outside swingin
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister Almost as if to... say
And when Im gone just carry on
Dont mourn rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im lookin down on you smilin
And I didnt feel a thing so baby
Dont feel no pain just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on
Dont mourn rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im lookin down on you smilin
And I didnt feel a thing so baby
Dont feel no pain
Just smile back
when i m gone a cappellaWhen Im GoneIm a little nutty and i know it
But if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that im not the only one whos off his rocker
There were many before me
I was always labelled the black sheep of the family
What a bad seed i grow to be
But if you take a look at us now
Youll see the apple didnt fall too far from the tree
haha
Alright look
Ima tell you the story from my side
Maybe youll understand
Check it out
You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain
People run from what the just dont get
Maybe shady shoulda just hit em with a little bit
Did i spit too soon? should i of spoon fed em it?
But i was just so eager to prove i was even worth
Being in the same league or the room with
Of the people of whom i was in
Every now and then i look up like i was seeking approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin
Or was it a figment of my imagination
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasnt a big deal back then
But to me it was see what it was was
I had developed the complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse now im next lets see who ?
Im in the booth staring back to see whos mugs
I get a reaction from usually the first thumb? was from proof
And the rest of the group backed him up
And no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals
It was real we just wanted tickets for that meal
Sometimes i feel like its just me
Sometimes i feel like im going crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree
I said...
Sometimes i feel like its just me
Sometimes i feel like im going crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree
Ever since my mother was pregnant
With her second egg cause she said
That i had a baby sister who fell out of the window
I was too young to remember
Kansas city projects
I was like   and how come
I remember malcolm isaac and boogie
If it was the projects in missouri?
Cause thosere my best friends until isaac
Took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up getting jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and -some stitches
Which is still to this day
Why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why part of my lifes so twisted
But i can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way that pictures one of my relatives
Sometimes i feel like its just me
Sometimes i feel like im going crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree
I said...
Sometimes i feel like its just me
Sometimes i feel like im going crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree
You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything i say is so insane
Whats different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But thats the last thing i need is for people
To walk around feeling sorry for me me
And im not a g never claimed to be
I gave my vest to cashis just hope he
Dont need it more than me
But well see cause we aint lookin for beef
But if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek?
Come on
Sometimes i feel like its just me
Sometimes i feel like im going crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree
I said...
Sometimes i feel like its just me
Sometimes i feel like im going crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree

Shovin the vacuum nozzle down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me the  month old baby to shake em up

Whos it belong to maybe the girl with the long blonde
hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly theres some wrong cause she didnt come home
Shes missing. Where is she? Something fishy is goin on

And the horror the terror for ya pappa sick n bye bye
Send a chopper die before ya reach the chapter
Cmon!
I smoke more than  chimney hatchets
Product of espionage
Pissed drunk on pepsi and Scotch
Sticking my fucking foot up a lesbians crotch while pedestrians watch
Gangsters bow down to a mightier villian
There might be a million outsidaz
Hiding on the side of your building
Say goodbye to your children
Notify your next to kin
Bring some extra men
If anyone on your team expects to win
The effects of gin made me a smart ass with a bossy mouth
Six bouncers had to come and toss me out some coffee house
It aint a riddle
After you flat line in the hospital
While Im in the middle row at your funeral wake
Fucking your widow
Someone call the nurse and tell her to strap me down I need a harness

Spitting blood like Kiss lead guitarist

My own words I guess...
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for?
Not the expression no literally give an arm for?
When they know theyre your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
Daddy look what I made Dads gotta go catch a plane

Ill bite your motherfuckin style just to make it fresher
I cant take the pressure Im sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin while Im washin dishes
In school I never said much too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam thats when my face grayed
Went to gym in th grade raped the womens swim team
Dont take me for a joke Im no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
Im going up over the curb driving on the median
Finally made it home but I dont got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming Fuck the world like Tupac
I just dont give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking telling your boys that Im on crack

So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack

Fuck the entire world!
just don t giveLook if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted. In one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombsBut he keeps on forgetting what he wrote downThe whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over bloah!
Snap back to reality Oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked
Hes so mad but he wont give up that
Easy no
He wont have it he knows his whole backs to these ropes
It dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke
Hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
The souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms close to post mortem
It only grows harder homie grows hotter
He blows. Its all over. These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows
Hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes dont want him no more hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da da da
No more games Im a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebodys paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I cant get by with my  to 
And I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama dramas screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail
Ive got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go its my shot.
Feet fail me not this may be the only opportunity that I got
You can do anything you set your mind to man

And I aint even plannin to call

Last name Ever first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy aint nothin to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown Nino
She insists she got more class we know
Swimmin in the money come and find me Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball Kimo
Drop the mix tape that shit sounded like an album
Whod have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal I did it without one
Yeah nigga Im about my business
Killin all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is askin for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness bitches
It may not mean nothing to yall

Kanye West
I used to have hood dreams big fame big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button what nuttin
Now super bad chicks givin me Mac lovin
Youd think I ran the world like Michelles husband
Youd think these niggas know me when they really doesnt
Like they was down with the old me no you fuckin wasnt
Youre such a fuckin loser he didnt even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothin was done for me
So I dont plan on stoppin at all

Okay hello its da martian space jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess Im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like Im runnin from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is like a fuckin roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im restin in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh my foots sleepin on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothin was done for me
So I dont plan on stoppin at all
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
Im sellin shit down at the mall
And tellin every girl she the one for me
And I aint even plannin to call
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
☆Eminem☆
There they go
Back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go
Macadamia they go so ballistic whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
Hes wonderin if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waitin patiently
For Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin in the brains of these hoes
And establishin a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that
Im talkin about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin up out of our mouths now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way
That you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter son
Just in case youre thinkin of savin face
You aint gonna have no face to save
By the time Im through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to yall
Understand nothin was done for me
So I dont plan on stoppin at all
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
Im sellin shit down at the mall
And tellin every girl she the one for me
And I aint even plannin to call
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man

Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he dont give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till its smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the MC
With the Christopher Reeves beef we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood? I shouldnt yes I should
Riding through the hood Im chilling with Westwood
Im quite mellow a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow I like jello Im like hello
dike

Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes
Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash bumping
Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn near﻿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge into on coming traffic
Caused a massive  car pile up not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard you can pass it on Im battery acid dog
You dont wanna get my ass ticked off
Im harder than playing basketball when Im going through crack withdraw
Dicks so big its like estlastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man
 with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic Sports

chonkyfireOnce again its the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman hes a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain he just finished huffin the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothin because it aint
Anything in his way his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares he glares making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep hes a tarantula gargantuan
Yeah Angela so I command ya to start dancin
Part Manson part Hannibal part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansen
Enter my gas chamber you gangsta? My ass
Hes got his fangs to your neck hes set to strangle ya ass hater
Youre facin a task greater hes chasin your ass
Hes got his face in a mask your blood stains on his glass table
Im checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while Im dozing off overdosing
Windows opening shutting doors opening closing
I think theres a ghost too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only sposed to swallow a half I took the whole thing
Im not joking I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink Im standing over the sink hosing
Myself self-loathing cause Im on a brink mostly
I dont wanna think this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings scream while Im severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
Im yodelling Rosie wont you come out to play?
And no sense wasting time cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred em
You never heard em like this so dont encourage him
The neurosurgeon coke mirrors and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn him convinced that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured em into the building and killed em
Buried em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spin straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk Motrin to Tylenol three pills
The Real Slim Shadys entered the buildin
Theres nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred hes ill with it he still shouldnt be healed
Theres no one as sick as he MCs will get fricassed on the grill then
microphoneA lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah Im afraid of death
I dont want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look I cant change the way I think
And I cant change the way I am
But if I offended you
Good
Cause I still dont give a fuck
Im zoning off of one joint stopping a limo
Hopped in the window shopping a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue what year is this?
Fuck a needle heres a sword body pierce with this
Living amok never giving a fuck
Gimme the keys Im drunk and Ive never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
Ill stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and burying guns in the mud
Ive calmed down now I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brains gone my souls worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my bodys still being operated on
Im ducked the fuck down while Im writing this rhyme
Cause Im probably gonna get struck with lightning this time
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
Ill hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
Cause Im crushing the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and Im armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your Mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match
Here momma try em on
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives
Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I cant rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bugged twitches
Im withdrawing from crack so bad my blood itches
I dont rap to get the women fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique Im a posse
Kamikaze strapping a motherfucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my Momma lost me
Im a cross between Manson Esham and Ozzy
I dont know why the fuck Im here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck I was born during an earthquake
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
still don t givePut it on my wee-wee
Banana strawberry pineapple orange Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it but I guess I cant
It shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out Hannah Montana
Man whats the matter have you no manners
No you know the girl from Junos address
Yeah Imma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe cant believe you fell for that
It coulda been a molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute man what the hell was that
I heard a noise where you going
What are you bananas
You cant go back there stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you Superman
All you have is a little stupid can of whipped cream
What the hell you gonna do with that
Imma put it on my wee-wee
Oh good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man go ahead what you waiting for
You better get them clothes off baby boy

They keep on sayin the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West maybe theyre just tryna distract it
From the fact that Im comin back
Or maybe its cause I aint black maybe its because of that
Maybe its because Im the highest sellin artist in rap
While Im sittin back in my office jackin off to my plaques

And Im still alive Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin my opponents think that Ive died
Thats when I just pop up outta nowhere

Are they asking me that because of the shit thats been thrown at me
This is a beat with no words at first it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind it’s brain strength training
My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low? Bring in a truckload with a high-low

Screwdriver my crews live when you cant sleep and youre still up

No shes not
Oh shit!
Come on motherfucker!
Marsh!
the kissWell I do pop pills
I keep my tube socks filled
And pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hos
Like a soap opera episode
Then punch a bitch in the nose
Until her whole face explodes
Theres three things I hate Girls women and bitches
Im that vicious to talk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night
A stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport sluggish walking on crutches
And hit a pregnant bitch in the stomach with luggage
Its like a dream I cant back out I black out
Im back out looking for someone of to beat
the crap out
Im bringing you rap singers
Two middle fingers
Flip you off in French and translate it in English
Then Im gonna vanish from the face of this planet
And come back speaking so much Spanish that Pun cant even understand it
pillsIm withholding my anger
Though Id like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussys puny neck
Its my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
Thats what he says to himself
As he uses magazines to trash me
As he sits with both feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just cant see that hes manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He dont exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And its destroying him slowly
Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now hes acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cause it annoys him to see that I aint scared
You aint no motherfucking bully
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking bully
I wont allow it aint gonna coward to no bully
Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully...
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally...
Now Im not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
Theres so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep pounding at me
Now that Im down with 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irvs on a string
And Irvs so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough
And Murder Inc.s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our buildings made out of bricks
So you aint taking out shit
And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cause you know we dont play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch
Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs Slang Toungue and Freaky Ta
Its like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybodys gotta be so fucking hard
Im not excluding myself
Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go but then again
Theres only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
Its no exception it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
Hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesnt kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I aint buzzed
Dawg Im talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Halies name
Irvine get your boy off that E...
Get at me dawg
Holla
bullys pt Somedays I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like Im surrounded by a wall of bricks
Everytime I go to get up I just fall in pits
My lifes like one great big ball of shit!
If I could just put it all into all I spit
Instead of always tryina swallow it
Instead of starin at this wall and shit
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit
Cant Call it Shit!
All I know is Im about to hit the wall
If I ever have to see another one of Moms alcaholic fits
This is it last straw
Thats all Thats it
I aint dealin with another fuckin politic
Im like a skillet bubblin until it filters up
Im about to kill it I can fill it buildin up
Blow this buliding up Ive been sealed enough
My cup runith over I done filled it up
The pen explodes and bust ink spills my guts!
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well. Imma show you what You gon feel my rush
If you dont feel it then it must be too real to touch
Build the dutch Im about to tear shit up
Goosebumps Yea Imma make your hair sit up Yea sit up
Imma tell you who I be Imma make you hate me Cuz you aint me
You wait it aint too late for you to finally see
What you close-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finders fee
Out this world aint no one out they mind as me
You need piece of mind? Heres a piece of mine
All I needs a line but Sometimes I dont always find the words to rhyme
To express how Im really feeling at that time Yes
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
Its just sometimes is always me
How dark can these hallways be
The clock strikes midnight
  then half passed 
This half-ass rhyme with this half-ass piece of paper
Im desperate at my desk
If I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest Again
Stuck in this slump Cant think of nothing
Fuck Im stumped Oh Wait Here comes something No!
Its not good enough scribble it out
New pad crinkle it up and throw the shit out
Im fizzling out thought I figured it out
Balls in my court but Im scared to dribble it out
Im afraid but why am I afraid? Why am I a slave
To this Trade? Sign not to spit to the grave
Real enough to rowl you up Want me to flip it? I can rip it
any style you want. Imma switch hitter bitch Jimmy Smith aint a quitter
Imma sitter till I get enough finally hit a fucking boiling point
Put some oil in your joints Flip the coin Bitch come get destroyed
And MCs worst dream I make them tensed they hate me
See me and shake like a Chainlink fence
By the looks of em you would swear that Jaws was coming
By the screams of them you would swear Im sawin someone
By the way they runnin you could swear that the law was coming
Its now or never And tonight is all or nothing
Momma Jimmy keeps leaving on us He said hed be back
He pinky promised I dont think hes honest
Ill be back baby I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock! Imma make them Eat this watch
Dont believe me Watch! Imma win this race
And Imma come back and rub my shit on your face Bitch!

Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your

Ill slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming Fuck the World like Tupac

Talking that shit behind my back dirty mackin
Telling your boys that Im on crack

Im nicer than Pete but Im on a Search to crush a Milkbone

Im ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
Im colder than snow season when its twenty below freezing
Flavor with no seasoning this is the sneak preview
Ill diss your magazine and still wont get a weak review
Ill make your freak leave you smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder
missiles
Slim Shady Eminem was the old initials Bye-bye!
Extortion snorting supporting abortion
Pathological liar blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
Impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
Half animal half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
Somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out!
Im a caged demon on stage screaming like Rage Against
The Machine
Im convinced Im a fiend shooting up while this record is
spinning
Clinically brain dead I dont need a second opinion
Fuck dropping the jewel Im flipping the sacred treasure
Ill bite your motherfucking style just to make it fresher
I cant take the pressure Im sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitching while Im washing dishes
In school I never said much too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam thats when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade raped the womens swim team
Dont take me for a joke Im no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and
smoking weed again
Im going up over the curb driving on the median
Finally made it home but I dont got the key to get in
Shit fuck everything...
Outsiders Pace One Young Zee.
Fuck the entire world...
just don tWhatever...
Dre just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
Just shut up and listen aiyyo...
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this - on this Earth
And since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress thats been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully peacefully...
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when Im eating or feeding my daughter
Do not come and speak to me speak to me...
I dont know you and noI dont owe you a motherfucking thing
Im not Mr. NSync Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr. Friendly I can be a prick
If you tick me my tank is on empty is on empty...
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Im lifting you  feet lifting you  feet... in the air
I dont care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of all you of all you...
I dont mean to be mean but thats all I can be is just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my fatherI hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant
And Oh its his lyrical content -
- the song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me finger at me...
So I point one back at em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
When you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
With the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
When a dudes getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn on Marilyn... and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where its at
Middle America now its a tragedy
Now its so sad to see an upper class city
Having this happening this happening...
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way rap this way...
But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and its burning and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Im so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label lets stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top on My Name is... 
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
That got me rotation at rocknroll stations
And I just do not got the patience got the patience...
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
Im some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep asking
The same fucking questions fucking questions...
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in
The why the who what when the where and the how
Til Im grabbing my hair and Im tearing it out
Cause they driving me crazy driving me crazy... I cant take it
Im racing Im pacing I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get
But I cant take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No I wont sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole Im glad
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
whateverHave you ever loved someone so much you give an arm for
Not the expression no literally give an arm for
When they know they your heart
and you know you were they armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
and everything you stand for turns on you despites you
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
Daddy look what I made dads gotta go catch a plane
Daddy wheres mommy?
I cant find mommy where is she?
I dont know go play Hailie baby your daddys busy
Daddys writing this song the song aint gon right itself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on a mother whos a spittin image of her
that Slim Shady yeah baby Slim Shadys crazy

And when Im gone just carry on
Dont mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im lookin down on your smile and
and now?? can feel a thing

I keep havin this dream
Im pushing Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming she dont want me to sing
Youre makin mommy cry

Baby daddy aint leavin no more

You always say this is the last time

Daddy please daddy dont leave daddy no stop it!
Goes in the pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket
Its got a picture thisll keep you safe daddy take it wit ya
I look up its just me standing in the mirror
These stinking walls must be talkin cause man I can hear em
Theyre sayin you got one more chance to do right and its to-night
Now go out there and show em that you love em fore its too late
And just as I go to walk outta my bedroom door it turns to a stage
theyre gone and the spotlight is on and Im singing...
Sixty thousand people are jumpin out they seat
The curtain closes theyre throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for comin out
Theyre screamin so loud I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down I dont believe what Im seeing
Daddy its me! Help mommy?? bleedin
But baby??? how did you get do Sweeden?
I followed you daddy
You told me that you werent leavin
You lied to me dad and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin it says  Number  Dad
Thats all I wanted I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point! Fine me and mommy are going
But baby wait!
Its too late dad you made your choice
Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us
Thats what they want they want you Marshall
They keep screamin your name
Its no wonder you cant go to sleep just take another Yeah I bet ya you will
You rap about it yeah word can keep it real
I hear applause all this time I couldnt see
How could it be that the curtain is closin on me?
I turn around find that underground bull
Put it to my brain scream God???
The sky darkens my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
Thats when I wake up alarm clocks ringin
Theres birds screamin its spring and Hailies outside swingin
I walked right up to Kim and kissed her tell her I missed her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if the...
gone againIm not afraid Im not afraid Yeah to take a stand to take a stand Its been a ride
Everybody I guess I had to everybody come take my hand Go to that place come take my hand To get to this one
Well walk this road together Now some of you through the storm
Whatever weather Might still be in that place cold or warm If youre tryin to get out
Just lettin you know that youre not alone Just follow me
Holla if you feel like Ill get you there youve been down the same road
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em
But you wont take the sting out these words before I say em
Cause aint no way Ima let you stop me from causin mayhem
When I say Ima do somethin I do it I dont give a damn
What you think Im doin this for me so fuck the world feed it beans
Its gassed up if it thinks its stoppin me
Ima be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me Im tearin down your balcony
No if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
From down to the last album hes still shittin
Whether hes on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first for better or worse
Hes married to the game like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse forget the earth hes got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
Im not afraid Im not afraid to take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody come take my hand come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just lettin you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road
OK quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shouldnt have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know its a rap
You said you was king you lied through your teeth for that
Fuck your feelins instead of gettin crowned youre gettin capped
And to the fans Ill never let you down again Im back
I promise to never go back on that promise in fact
Lets be honest that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax I aint goin back to that now
All Im tryna say is get back click-clack-bloww
Cause I aint playin around theres a game called circle
And I dont know how Im way too up to back down
But I think Im still tryin to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt this fuckin black cloud
Still follows me around but its time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin jumpin jacks now
Im not afraid Im not afraid to take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody come take my hand come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just lettin you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road
And I just cant keep livin this way
So startin today Im breakin out of this cage
Im standin up Ima face my demons
Im mannin up Ima hold my ground
Ive had enough now Im so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And dont even realize what you did believe me you
I been through the ringer but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead no more beef flingers
No more drama from now on I promise
To focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldnt lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause Im raisin the bar I shoot for the moon
But Im too busy gazin at stars I feel amazin and Im not
Im not afraid Im not afraid to take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody come take my hand come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just lettin you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel like youve been down the same road
not afraid radio editSh-Sh-Sh-Shady
Aftermath ha ha

First we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Scream one last time
Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time get your ass up for the Doctor
Come on now here we go
Cliff hanger its another club banger
Got you hangin on the edge of your seat
Get on down
Times up games over you lose I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah new year next phase begin
Look whos got you goin crazy again
Im a trend I set one every time Im in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad that means your something that we already had
But once youre gone you dont come back too bad
Youre off the map now radar cant even find you
We stay on the grind you slip we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin whinin and bitchin
Sit and observe listen youll learn if you pay attention
Why  multi-platinum albums later three diamond
Worldwide were on the charts with a bullet and still climbin
First we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk you will get it crunk get it crunk
Crunk crunk crunk
And when  Cent says jump you get on one foot and jump
Jump jump jump jump
The buzz is tremendous we drop you all to sense it
I dont gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We aint showin off we just goin off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this Doc is that you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc cause Doc left you all guessin
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record what
We gon have this motherfucker hoppin in a second bump bump
Thats why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cause we done swam with the sharks wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game thats why we came to
First we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Scream one last time
 Cent come on!
Bounce now hands up you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
Its no secret everybody know
When Dres involved theres plenty money involved
And plenty honeys involved the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali every day its just another party from the valleys
All the way to them  Mile alleys lets rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio bangin out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker
So nervous aint never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc and Shady
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
First we came here to set this party off right
Lets bounce tonight
And if they dont let us in through the front
Well come through the side
Cuz I dont ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right
Scream one last time
Yeah ha ha

Back when Mark Wahlberg was marky mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix hen with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk

and youll be sick then and youll probly barf
and my prediction is that you gon probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and everythings spinnin your beginning to
think women are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wilin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyen ya
get in the car and start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a  car pile up
Earth calling pilot to co-pilot looking for life on this
planet sir no sign of it
All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and
Im so high that I might die if i go by it.
Let me out of this place Im outta placeIm in in outter space Ive just

It doesnt take much
For me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You aint even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush
I cant explain what it is my brain does
But however it works its insane
Its plain nutz
And it aint just my brain thas dangerous
Its a whole combination of things
It takes nutz
And im not affriad to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the banks and  trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
Im patiently waiting for the day
Im anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs
When you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk
Ya aint tough
Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
This is me talking motherfucker
This aint drugs
You wanna pop shit wake-up then make-up
FUCK THAT
Its too late chump now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
Till i pull the paint off
I never been shot
But i think me and  musta been cut from the same cloth
Cause ive always came off
Like jas chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I dont stop
The only thing i wait for
Is day that i dont gotta report to probate court
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more
Cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja
And ima read that motherfucker off from april
You pussies think i went soft since  mile
When i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
Trust me
Monkey see monkey do
Dont ever make the first move
Just let em come to you
Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
So let em come to you

berzerkyou probably gonna think that im talking about you and you goddamn right i am
look at you this is the minimal i could diss you
subliminally but i think criminal instinct
has pushed me to the brink my pussy does it stink
he still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
he does doesnt he still is isnt he?
nah im just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
i can still fuck him and leave him whenever i feel frisky
and is no risk of disease cause he aint with anyone is he?
this bitch really thinks she can get me
if she still wants me driving across country
strapped him to the front seat missing all the front teeth
thinking to herself whens the next time hes gonna punch me?
i told this cunt shes gonna over-do it once
and once she does she was stuffed up in a trunk
crunch he scrunched her up in a ball
bunched up nice and comfy
fuck around get dumped up in a lake fore you dump me
you cunning little cunt deceitful witch
you thought you had me till my shrink told me this
the problem is all inside your head she said to me
the answer is easy if you take it logically
id like to help you in your struggle to be free
there must be  ways to leave your lover
i feel like a serial killer
i keep dumping bodies in the lake ima get caught and send up the river
i shiver when i think of the company i keep
how do i know she aint gonna kill me when i sleep
i shriek every time she hands me something to drink
sex kept us together when we slept together every-thing
was all better she made me feel like a king
slowly she began lowering my self-esteem
she go to the club and not answer the phone when i call her
and i just bought her a truck for   dollars
accused me of doing drugs and screaming holla
then i find a bag of coke on her some marijuana
and all i know is every time i go
to them hiding spots wherever she hides her blow
the little bags of dope there was a pile of coke
thats growing smaller and that was just a while ago
and i wouldnt even let on like i know
what was i supposed to do call her out on it we just argue
say she put it down on purpose and flipped the whole script
ooh shes a manipulative evil bitch
a cunning little cunt little deceitful witch
she thought she had me till my shrink told me this
the problem is all inside your head she said to me
the answer is easy if you take it logically
id like to help you in your struggle to be free
there must be  ways to leave your lover
thru the fireI dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
Farewell miss I know that you can care less
But Im sorry for everything I was careless
But I need you to know that I love you so much
And Ive been drinking myself to sleep my souls crushed
A couple more shots I know Im gonna go nuts
I cant deal with the fact you left me with no crutch
I was in love with you how could you do this to me
Actually I did this to myself what a tragedy!
And now what do I do?
Where do I go?
Cause everywhere I go I see your face
Its hard starting over
Trying to find another shoulder
To lean on
I feel like my whole life just got peed on
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain
As crazy as it sounds to me its sane
And I like it why? cause I feel like were still united
In some weird way I dont wanna fight it
I dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
I wrote you the other day and you didnt write back!
Its like that!? after all the crap we been through!?
I cant believe you! I know I fucked up!
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!
You keep sending me to voicemail!
Im annoyed hell! shit you coulda at least sent a text
But youre probably busy kissing someone elses lips
While Im sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!
Youre hard headed a sharp headache
I need help call a medic
I just cut myself yeah I did it
Without you Im nothing dont you get it!?
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it!
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that
We ever met I cant believe you just said that
Youre so cold you just hit me so low
I cant take this no more so hit the road
I dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
Some things just dont seem the way they do
One day you tell me I love you and only you
I wake up to find out it was a dream
Youre telling me you hate me youre leaving me
People change everything changes
We go from best friends then become strangers
We go from seeing each other everyday then
Farewell to never seeing your face again
I cant get you outta of my head
So Im out of bed at  in the morning
Wishing I was dead
But for some odd reason I cant do it
For some reason I needed to write
Whats on my mind and whats going through it
Cause if I dont Ill probably suffocate
Why do you have so much hate
Towards me you need some loving babe
God I fucking love you I hate myself
For falling in love with you
Just to find out all I did was trouble you
My heart is aching Im medicated
I tried meditating
But nothing works I dont even feel sedated
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked
Fuck humiliation you do anything to get me back
Opinions wouldnt matter what they thought in fact
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good
And do everything to have me if you could
I dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry

Perfect way to get back wanna hear something wick-wack?

Wow Mariah didnt expect ya to go balls out
Bitch shut the fuck up fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wild n out before Nick
when you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you dont want Nick finding out
You probably think cause its been so long if I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary Mary Poppins Im mixing our studio session down and sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do Mariah it ever occur to you
that I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
and that goes for Nick too Faggot you think Im scared of you?
You gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like Ima sit and fight with you over some slut-bitch-cunt
that made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
and only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah what you gonna say Im lucky?
Tell the public that I was so ugly that you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base what the fuck you tell Nick punk? In
the second week we was dry humping
Its gotta count for something
Listen girly
Surely you dont want me to talk about how I nutted early cause I ejaculated prematurely
and bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
and said I was gross go get a towel your stomachs curling
Well maybe you do
But if Im embarrassing me Im embarrassing you
And dont you dare say it isnt true
As long as the songs getting airplay Im dissing you
Im a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars we aint even third of the way through
Damn Slim Mariah played you. Mariah who?
Oh did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too
Like Ive been going off on you all this time

Check ya wine cellar look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now Im about to draw the line
And for you to cross it thats a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldnt find
on an episode of Cribs A blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so dont go opening your jibs
Cause every time you do its like an overload of fibs
I aint saying this shit again ho you know what it is
Its a warning shot fore I blow up ya whole spot
Call my bluff and Ill release every fucking thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin to stick two CDs in the same slot
Slim Shady drop them dodgers Slim Shady drop them dodgers I love you

Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear boo. Now what you say?

invasionINSTRUMENTAL
evlenmeden olmazYou claim if you get knocked by the cops
Youll give em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment shoot the bailiff
Karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
Ill just call the shotty entertainment
If yall was in the party gettin faded
On molly had the audience sedated
You wouldnt catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But youd be the first lobbyin to claim it
Bitch stop bein a lame
Your hobby is in robbery and dismemberin body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawing them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Aint nobody dippin out the back of
the club like Oh my God hes trippin
Only time you get the blade is probably
with the dang lawn equipment aint it?
Wouldnt take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein debated
Youre still copyin Xeroxing Im still coppin a feel
Like Bill Cosby at willpopping a pill then spill Oxys in Jills coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts never sensible
Kiss my butt my set of principles is gone
But til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch its Donald
Shits on bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka stiff arm her
While Im hittin on Melania
And this songs for all ya
Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud through the dirt
But Ima make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down but you better let me up
Cause youre only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up
Til everybody eats my turds
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin ham at candy yam on nanny cam
Im gettin handys with the ? Xannys in the Caddy armrest
Im imagining objects so Im batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
And ? got the panoramic camera
Xanax a banana hammock and a Santa hat
Im smellin like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and Im actin half it
Grow up? Nah
Not that I know of yall
Basement just got a frickin overhaul got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio
of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
an interracial blow-up doll and Rachel Dolezal
Youre so appalled sos my manager
Bitch Im amateur fuck a pro career
Coast is clear but nowhere to go from here
And nobodys close so dont compare
They aint nowhere near Im way over here
My competition cant see me
Cause I dont own a mirror
But Marshall you are terrific so smart and gifted
Im so narcissistic when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxietys throwin gang signs
But I made strides with these raid blinds
Im cuttin back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang bang bang bang time
Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
You couldnt eat citrus the same size
As the blade I push into ? when I...
Pull em like... sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway Im a really bad hombre
Come play belly dance on me
Ive been making wedding plans all day
Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud through the dirt
But Ima make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down but you better let me up
Cause youre only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up
Til everybody eats my turds
Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl take this pole like a survey
Today wasnt my birthday
But Im caked up like a dessert tray
So were in shape
Cause youre in a slurrin state
Im a  youre an 
Like what I do before after and youre in ?
You wanna get into a pissin contest and find out whos better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Not in high school grad Im not a scholar
But Im so cold that Im droppin out with my degrees
Its the same as I got in college zero
But nobodys hotter you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like ? partner that blow me
Told you Im so dirty homie you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on
And get to soakin try to get to poke a hole in
Why you hoes be off? And nope I wont be washed
You hope to God I dont explode I gotta blow this spot up though
I got a lotta more
I wont put the sugar coating on it though
Cause sometimes you can feel like your energys expired
Raps got you drained dead tired zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look man like the feds buggin my phone uh huh
I get why youre tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
Cause sometimes I might get sad
Well I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when lifes a drag
Told her to do like her dad dont cry get mad
Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
Im hyper by the time you see this side of me
Im right in your ass
Fore the penI stood up for the kid who had to put up
with the bullies at his school at his school
You aint have to have no money or go
shoppin just to cop a fuckin attitude
Now my doughs amountin to a
mountain its rised too high to count it
Never asked to be richall I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and Im enraged
Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
Itd be minimum wage
But its embedded in my head and if I hunted for the bread
And what I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
But Im never gonna get the credit for
the sweat and blood I put up in the pen
And when Im dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever cause Ill never get
Another mothafuckin opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can
Cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud through the dirt
But Ima make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down but you better let me up
Cause youre only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
Cause I swear when I get up Im never gonna let up
Til everybody eats my turds
offendedIm ice grilling you staring you down with a gremlin grin
Im Eminem youre a fag in a womens gym
Im slim cos shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
spasmodic
Strapped to a crafmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in a hospital in critical condition
I flat lined jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed
IV full of Thai-weed
Looking Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins joined at the groins like lesbians
Pins and needles hypodermic needles and pins
I hope god forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killing my girlfriends
phone tap freestyleIn your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie-ie-ie
Whats in your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie-ie-ie oh
Im backing up my shit
Smoke shit in the cars
I can fit and Im just driving as far as I can get
Away from these problems to all my sorrows I forget
Whats tomorrow like? Cause tonight Im starting life again
Kids in the corner wont stop fucking my ignoring
Besides psycho when I fantasize
Starting my whole life over yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I dont even recognize no one
I try to look alive because theres nothing like
Holding your head up high when youre dead inside
And I just hide so in case youre wondering why my insides showing
Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so Im
Picking them up and stuff them in the back
Fuck it Ive done enough in this rap shit Recovery brought me nothing
But back to where I was and perhapsthis couldve been my victory lap if I wasnt on the verge of Relapse
In your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie-ie-ie
Whats in your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie-ie-ie oh
It seems to be the reoccurring main thing
The shit I would daydream
As a kid I was eighteen
I went from an irate
Teenager to still raging
Amazing
Back then I put eight thing
Into the rhyme whether it was sad mad happy or angry
I spit it the mainstream I hit it
Blame me I did it Did what? Hailie
Baby I didnt mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shouldve did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining for real life but this
Dang thing is still the hardest thing to explain
Is the crazy or should I?
Ever seen it back then it was like I aint even
Bother to taken into consideration
You and ? baby and older and make hear me say things
I did it pay me and be it just aint me
Okay so ladies and gentle men berate everything
Is the main reason that I feel like a lame piece of shit
Or should I? Start cranking in bitter
Come playing beef and pick up by the same things
Cause when I look at me I dont see what they see
I feel the same greedy and lately Ive been contemplating
Escaping to get a ranger or whatever this road takes me
Is making me crazy Whats in my?
In your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie-ie-ie
Whats in your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie-ie-ie oh
in your headGuess who?

Im sorry were alone
I wrote my chapter
Youll turn the page when Im gone
I hope youll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I aint scared
Whatever it takes to raise you Im prepared
To do whatever to do whatever
December st  dear Hailie
This is your song
Youll be coming out of mommys stomach soon
I better do something quick if Ima be able to support you
I can barely support me but as long as youre healthy
Thats all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be just thinking ahead
Ima make it if it kills me
Lets see how far I can take it with this music
Im getting sick of chasing this illusion
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hands shaking please excuse me
Dads a little nervous but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while Im saying rhymes and write em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As Im using in this letter maybe they can feel me as Im
Trying to build these castles out of sand baby girl
For you to sit on the throne I got plans baby girl
Welcome to mom and dads crazy world
Love daddy
Maple flavored kisses buttered pancakes and syrup
I built this castle now we are trapped on the throne
Im sorry were alone
I wrote my chapter
Youll turn the page when Im gone
I hope youll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I aint scared
Whatever it takes to raise you Im prepared
To do whatever to do whatever
December st  dear Hailie
You got your mommas personality same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that a little minor mishap
But youll grow into em baby
Im on the grind now
Im doing little shows open mics all-nighters and studios
While Im tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like Im so close to this dream yet so far?
I just keep steering
Im gonna turn into someone
I havent the slightest clue what Im gonna do if it falls through
You took your first steps today youll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped too many soft tunes
Theyre talking bad about dad its ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I dont belong or something ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future Im hoping its you
Open this envelope when youre older and it holds true
I built this castle now we are trapped on the throne
Im sorry were alone
I wrote my chapter
Youll turn the page when Im gone
I hope youll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I aint scared
Whatever it takes to raise you Im prepared
To do whatever to do whatever
December th  dear Hailie
Now if you found these letters I guess I better try to explain
A lots happened in between em since I rised to this fame
Ive said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy I wanted to claim my love for you but damn
I never knew itd be like this
If I did I wouldnt have done it
You aint asked for none of this shit
Now youre being punished?
Things that shouldve been private with me and your mother is public
I cant stomach they can take this fame back I dont want it
Ill put out this last album then Im done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it Im hanging it up fuck it
Excuse the cursing baby but just know
That Im a good person though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsentake this letter I wrote as a goodbye note
Because your dads at the end of his rope
Im sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie I better go Im getting sleepy
Love dad
Shit I dont know
castleIf I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox
One day for every pill
Or percocet that I ate
Cut down on the valium
Thatll hurt everything
But death is turning so definite wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you being
Didnt want you to know I was struggling
Feels like Im underwater
Submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say
My liver and kidneys arent functioning
Been flirtatious with death
Skirt-chasing I guess
Its arrivederci
Same nurse just heard say
Theyre unplugging me
And its your birthday
Jade Im missing your birthday
Baby girl Im sorry
I fucking hate when you hurt Hai
And sweeties thank you for waiting
To open gifts
But girls you can just open em
Dad aint making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist
But I cant make one Im frozen stiff
I yell but nothing comes out
Im crying inside I shout
My vocal cords wont permit me
I scream but its not allowed
You put your arm around mama
The karma wow
I just thought about the aisle
Ill never get to walk us down
Never see you
Graduate in your caps and gowns
Its bout to be 
Hows this happening now?
Ive got so much more to do
And Proof Im truly sorry
If I let you down but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes Nikes like new
For me for school
Doody Im trying but you
You were the glue that binded
So many things time
Id give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls
And constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls
And I couldnt sleep at night cause
That image burned in my brain
Of you on the table
Me falling across your body
Not able to stand to save you
God why did you take him?
Im tryna keep his legacy alive
But Im dying wheres Nathan?
Little ladies be brave
Take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures
Always cherish each other
Ill always love ya
And Ill be in the back of your memory
And I know youll never forget me
Just dont get sad when remembering
And little bro keep making me proud
You better marry that girl
Cause shes faithfully down
And when youre exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there I would
And should you ever see parenthood
I know youll be good at it
Oh almost forgot to do something
Thank my father too
I actually learnt a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And Mom wish Id have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart
Honest and open talk to you
Doody I see you
I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body
And float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed
Pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head
Shut the room down
Girls please dont get upset
I see those cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck
So forcibly dont wanna let
Me go pillow drenched
Emotional wrecks
With every second
Each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart
Begin to beat slow then a breath
Machines go beep beep beep
Mustve guessed the cheat codes to this shit
Im tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape
Make a beeline
Try and awake
From this dream I need to re-find
My inner strength
To remind me
Even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake
Im rewinding the tape
I dont want it
Ill put out this last album then Im done with it
One hundred percent finished fed up with it
Im hanging it up fuck it
Excuse the cursing baby but just know
That Im a good person though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen but I bet you they wont
Im pledging to throw this mephodome in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing closing credits can roll
Im proud to be back
Im bout to like a rematch
Outdo Relapse
With Recovery Mathers LP
Help propel me to
Victory laps
Gas toward them and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
Thats the song Id have sang to my daughters
If Id have made it to the hospital
Less than two hours later but I fought it
Came back like a boomerang on em
Now a new day is dawning
Im up Tuesday its morning
Now I know

But I cant figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate Umm...
And Dr. Dre said Slim Shady you a basehead!
Uh-uh! Then whys your face red? Man you wasted!
Well since age twelve Ive felt like Im someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lees tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Cmere slut! Shady wait a minute thats my girl dawg!

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot next semester Ill be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler stapled his nuts to a stack of paper Ow-w-w-w!
Walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extra-terrestrial running over pedestrians
In a spaceship while theyre screamin at me Lets just be friends!
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do Damn!
I told her Id grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her Oh thank you!
You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans Ahh! Ahhhhh!
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph Dude can I get your autograph?

Im not ready to leave its too scary to die Fuck that!
Ill have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive Huh yup!
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka dare me to drive? Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide Whoops!
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk Hahh-too
I spit when I talk Ill fuck anything that walks Cmere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How ya gonna breast-feed me Mom?! You aint got no tits! Waah wahh!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head Bang!

my name is rukiz blendFeeling kinky lip syncing to Too horts Freaky Tales Biatch!
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like shes decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNAll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man he hears you I dont think he cares
He gives a fuck even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin out of me please beware
Her TV blares cant hear the creaking stairs
Shes unaware in no underwear shes completely bare
Turns around and screams I remember distinctly
I said Im here to do sink repairs
Chop her up put her body parts
In front of Steven Averys trailer and leave em there
But hey man I was framed
I know what this looks like officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I aint murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But Im just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
Theres a missing person so what? Hes
Got nothin to do with me
Im almost certain I was framed
Woke up it was dawn musta knew somethin was wrong
Think Im becomin a monster cause of the drugs that Im on
Donald Ducks on theres a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond cause its incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl that motherfuckin baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin newspaper articles cuttin out sections from it
Memorys too fucked to remember destructive temper
Cut my public defenders jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
Cause I disassembled the body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
Im wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
But hey man I was framed
I know what this looks like officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I aint murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But Im just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
Theres a missing person so what? Hes
Got nothin to do with me
Im almost certain I was framed
Still on the loose they
Spotted me inside McDonalds Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap lookin like your college roommate
With Rihanna Lupe Saddam Hussein Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For edited eight women who hate men
Dont make it no weirder Im naked
When I break in your basement
Under your babys play pen I lay in wait adjacent
Facin the door remainin patient while stayin complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes that when you get home
Youll get the hint ho Im in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No officer you see...
I was framed
I know what this looks like officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I aint murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But Im just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
Theres a missing person so what? Hes
Got nothin to do with me
Im almost certain I was framed
framedIve drowned in high from the ashes
Now I cant recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of whats left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival

 bonnie and clydeYall know me still the same OG
But I been low key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese no deals and no Gs no wheels and no keys
No boats no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me cause
I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and its all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But yall think Im gonna let my dough freeze
Ho Please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-Es Ice Cubes and D.O.Cs the Snoop D O double Gs
And a group that said motherfuck the police?
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasnt doing too good
Whos the doc that they told you to go see?
Yall better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flopped
yall are the reason Dre aint been getting no sleep
So fuck yall all of yall
If yall dont like me blow me
Yall are gonna keep fucking around with me
And turn me back to the old me
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
So what do you say to somebody you hate?
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of NWA.
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy give me an awkward eye what you looking at?
And strangled him off in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I dont give a fuck if its dark or not
Im harder than me tryna park a Dodge
But Im drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch call the cops
Ima kill you and them loud ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still werent found out Right Here
so from here on out its the Chronic 
Starting today and tomorrows the new
And Im still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew
Slim shady hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid s
Calling men ladies
Sorry Doc but I been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
Its OK go with him Hailie Dadda?
If it was up to me
You motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me
Like you want something free
When my last CD was out you wasnt bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you wont get a crumb from me
Cause Im from the streets of Compton
I told em all
All them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I aint got none
What you think I sold em all
Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off
I aint having that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It aint gonna be nothing after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back
So wheres all the mad rappers at?
Its like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that I was strapped with gats
When you were cuddling a cabbage patch
forget about dreA lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah Im afraid of death
I dont want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look I cant change the way I think
And I cant change the way I am
But if I offended you
Good
Cause I still dont give a fuck
Im zoning off of one joint stopping a limo
Hopped in the window shopping a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue what year is this?
Fuck a needle heres a sword body pierce with this
Living amok never giving a fuck
Gimme the keys Im drunk and Ive never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
Ill stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and burying guns in the mud
Ive calmed down now I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brains gone my souls worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my bodys still being operated on
Im ducked the fuck down while Im writing this rhyme
Cause Im probably gonna get struck with lightning this time
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
Ill hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
Cause Im crushing the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and Im armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your Mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match
Here momma try em on
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives
Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I cant rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bugged twitches
Im withdrawing from crack so bad my blood itches
I dont rap to get the women fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique Im a posse
Kamikaze strapping a motherfucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my Momma lost me
Im a cross between Manson Esham and Ozzy
I dont know why the fuck Im here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck I was born during an earthquake
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
still don t give a fkUncle Marshall
Will you tell us a bedtime story?
Here we go
Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
Me and you Clef were gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and lets paint my ass
Hey mister would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin Im about to administer
To this ass-kissin little vaginal blister
Stanabis little Marshall Mathers sister
And in this corner we have the mister
Not havin it its the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonist fagot dick-suckin
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
Im bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I aint wanna have to diss ya
Cannabis where the fuck you at? I miss ya
Can I bitch oh can I bitch?
Where for art thou can I bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin with
Can I bitch oh can I bitch?
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh can I bitch?
Now at first I aint really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
Its can I bitch on some Stan Lives shit
It creeped me out at first man this is sick
For me being just a sick this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin me shit
Like you respect me like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I aint return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter Slim you really startin to upset me
The fifth letter told me you were comin to get me
The sixth letter theres a bomb threat in our building
This crazy motherfuckers really tryin to kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some sht about a message you left
Oh shit thats not an E thats an A
This dude wants to leave me a massage hes gay
Right away Im on the phone with Dr. Dre
We got a bogey
Marshall Im on the way
Can I bitch oh can I bitch?
Where for art thou can I bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin with
Can I bitch oh can I bitch?
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh can I bitch?
So in two seconds flat Dres at my crib
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship shit
Oh Dre wait a minute thats it
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
We can fly over the border lets go
So were off to Toronto and were gainin speed
What was that? Oh
Fuck it keep goin no time to waste
Wait backup hit him one more time in case
Okay fuck now hes draggin under the car
Oh well only thirty more thousand miles
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin to conversate
Just tryin to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin to figure out what happened to Germaine Propaine
He couldnt have fell off that hard Aint no way
What happened to the way you was rappin when you was scandalous
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist
Plus he raps with his regular voice
What was that?
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figure if I stick him with a fork hes done
So I stabbed him twice kept jabbin Christ
He wont die this guys like a battered wife
Hes like Kim he keeps comin back for more
But he wont fight back I cracked his jaw
Hold up Bis quit foldin up
Punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch
Do somethin at least one punchline
Cmon till the meter reads   
Ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde
Bis cmon answer me man respond
Tell me bout the sun rain moon and stars
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
Bite another line from Redmans song
Suddenly the stub from a dead mans arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
Its JD this motherfucker wont die neither
Dre starts sprayin him with cans of ether
We stomped the bitch and then stomped the bitch again
Compton
Detroit bitch talk some shit again
Stomp him stomp him
Switch feet switch again
Dre alright hes dead dog quit kickin him
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again
Damn
He disappeared yo hes gone he did it again
Can I bitch oh can I bitch?
Where for art thou can I bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin with
Can I bitch oh can I bitch?
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh can I bitch?
can i bitchAnd I started from the bottom
Like a snowman ground up
Like round chuck still put hands on you
Staying wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free confidence high
Such a breeze when I pin rhymes
I just got the air about me
Like wind chimes yeah
Another day in the life uh
Used to have to scrape to get by yeah
Now my community is gated
And I made it and my neighbors say hi say hi
Im giving them pounds Im upscale now
Guess it means Im way in the sky
But I still remember the days of minimal wage for
General labor welfare recipients is a minor
Look at how government assistance has made ya
Adversity if at first if you dont succeed
Put your temper to more use cause being broke is a poor excuse
That shit only gives you more fuel
Show them why youre you
So close God its like I almost got it
But close only counts in timebombs and horseshoes
So I uni-bomb shit tick tick tick
No remorse
Screw it Im lit and that attitude I blew up on quick
Thats why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick wick wick wick with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done nah bitch not quite
Spotlights back on got my faith wheres yours?
Do you still believe
In me?
Didnt I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
I never quit Do you still believe?
In me?
Man I know sometimes these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me theres just ink blots
I just fling them like slingshots and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger is free as a bird
New warhead-ed birth you just forehead-ed on earth
Too short for a verse studied his formula
Learned how to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in it and turn
Cause four-letter words are more better
Heard the world force-fed a turd to me
Youre getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it
But I just get so into it
I was there consoling you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door you walked over to it
Im the light at the end of tunnel so people are
always looking at me as theyre going through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear shit becomes too much to bear
Since Cleaning Out My Closet when
I was having trouble with the snare
Im that unrealistic prayer answered
And Ima get you jacked uplike youre trying to fix a flat uh when you struggle with a spare
That double fisted bearknuckles coupled with this pair of nuts Im cupping
I am your fucking switch nothing can compare
Do you still believe
In me?
Didnt I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
I never quit Do you still believe?
In me?
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my batterys low
Im gonna need a booster in my pack
I know I always got Proof on my back
I called you a groupie cause I knew for a fact
My insulin ho
Homie Im calling on you cause I think
Im slowly startin to lose faith in it so
Give me that quick mota.
Motivation to go Hussein with the flow
Fake fans with the two-faced that show
Let heartbeats loot produce hate in my soul
Laying vocals two days in a row
True statement hate to go down this road
But theres only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose chains
Cause all my dues paid
But this booth is taking its toll
But its never too late to start a new beginning
That goes for you too
So what the fuck are you gonna do use the tools youre given?
Or are you going to use the cards you were
dealt as an excuse for you to not do shit with them
I used to play the loser victim
Until I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I havent ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs hourglasses
If time was still on my side Id still have none to waste
Man in my younger days that dream was so much fun to chase
Its like I ran in place while this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace and
the hunger pangs once youve won the race
When that pool of exhaust is cooling off
Cause you dont got nothing left to prove at all
Cause you done already hit them with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need
To go through and deal with that Bruce Willis
That blue steel that truth still
When that wheels loose I wont lose will
Do you still believe?
believeDamn girl
You drive me crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things I normally wouldnt do
You make me feel things that I never felt
You gotta be the real thing cause you remind me of myself
remind me introWho came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough?
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl?
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed Fuck the world!
Slim Shady so come and kill me while my names hot
And shoot me  times in the same spot
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy I told you that I cant stop
You gotta make em fear you before you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or Ima come and kill you
I got mushrooms I got acid I got tabs and aspirin tablets
Im your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me Im your friend when you need a Mini Thin
Im Shady!
I like happy things Im really calm and peaceful
I like birds bees I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
Cause this is how I am in real life
I dont want to just die a normal death no I wanna be killed twice
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they havent even done yet?
So bring the money by tonight cause your wife said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
Cause Im the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think Ill write my biggest fan a fuck you letter
I got mushrooms I got acid I got tabs and aspirin tablets
Im your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me Im your friend when you need a Mini Thin
Im Shady!
I listen to your demo tape and act like I dont like it
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
People dont buy shit no more they just dub it
Thats why Im still broke and had the number one club hit
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it Ive got herpes while we on the subject
And if I told you I had AIDS yall would play it
Cause you stupid motherfuckers think Im playing when I say it
Well I do take pills dont do speed
Dont do crack dont do coke I do smoke weed
Dont do smack I do do shrooms do drink beer
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mamas not dead shes still alive and bitchin
And I dont have herpes my dicks just itchin
Its not syphilis and as for being AIDS infested
I dont know yet Im too scared to get tested
I got mushrooms I got acid I got tabs and aspirin tablets
Im your brother when you need
Some good weed to set you free
You know me Im your friend when you need a Mini Thin
Im Shady!
I told you I was Shady
Yall didnt believe me
Im Shady!
And thats my name
im shadyAlmost forgot
Youre comin with me
Lets go baby lets go
Lets go baby lets go
Lets go baby lets go
Lets go baby lets go
final thought skitI bust in devilish grin disgustin
Asshole freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals get on the floor
When I pop up on some Whack-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack big ol tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Bodies bananas and sass to go wit
I spot you at first glance and go shit
You wearin those pants that dont fit
That butt wont ever give up
Thats why you stick it out no matter what
Cause you got an ass that wont quit
So get on the horn my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument get a grasp and blow
You just laugh and go heehee
Cause youre just as nasty so thats appropriate
Thats why
I love you cause you remind me of me
Thats why I love you cause youre like me yeah me
I said I love you cause remind me of me
Thats why I love you cause youre like me nasty yeah me
You know Im wearin a new shirt tonight too yo
With me on it
Im lookin at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plans to bring you to my house
Youre drinkin Jack and Beam
Im thinking soon as trampolines so we should bounce
But youre out of your two-top if
youre thinking that mi casa es su casa
Yeah youre a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl youre smoking like Snoop Dogg
But you must be Token if you think youre taking over my quarters
There goes the diamonds and the jukebox
Two shots of blue hypnotic and soon Ill
Turn this bruuha to a bar room brawl
So hit scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk Im just too raw
But apparently so are you ma
Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And thats why
I love you cause you remind me of me
Thats why I love you cause youre like me yeah me
I said I love you cause you remind me of me
Thats why I love you cause youre like me nasty yeah me
Said can I take you home where we can be alone
Shawty you the shit
Girl I ordered you to sit
I know youre probably feeling me more than you admit
Pull up a chair sweetie let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
From the bottom to the top floor to ceiling
You aint run of the mill youre one in a million
Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones
So come and spend the night with the guy most terrified of
But tonight curiosity overrides ya
Besides ya I love
Like a stunter pistol
Crystal and slides huns tonight Im your pilot
Cause you should be up in the sky girl youre so fucking fly
You belong in the mile high club
So come on baby the nights young
Dont string me along Im heartstrung
We might wind it up unbound like were trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin fore we get to the house screwin our brains out
Like changing a lightbulb
Thats why I like ya cause Im crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain you screw mine up
I barely can think straight your head game is a mindfuck
So ready set aim and fire
Yes babe Im fallin in likeness kinda
But I love
I love you cause you remind me of me
Thats why I love you cause youre like me yeah me
I said I love you cause you remind me of me
Thats why I love you cause youre like me nasty yeah me
remind meLady you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass cheek implants call that an asset
Cause you can set a glass on it its massive
From the first time I saw you I actually
said to myself I gotta meet her like a taxi
Exactly love affair in the backseat
Sorry if Im being graphic but Im stiff as a statue
You sat on a shelf I feel like a bust
Maybe Im just ahead of myself
Let me slow down slow your Camaro
Im tryna catch up Im tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the meow hope its not a problem in fact
About the only fact I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Dont snap its supposed to be grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch
I just wanna climb in the sack
Ima keep it  like my speedometers at
Im watching you rap Im the dude following back
About six cars back Im in the lac
And I want to uh
All day all day all night
You ask I stay the night
With you you say youre vile
Me too youre burning up
Im running...
All day all night
You feel my heat fire...
Feel feel feel feel feel my heat
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But those jeans you wore like Ive never seen before
I pretend to work there while I clean the floor
Checking you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull up behind you while youre leaving
and you dont even know it ayo Rick man
Shes brushing her hair adjusting her mirror shes rapping my shit
But she wasnt aware I was thereor maybe she was and just didnt care
Who knows at least that isnt up in the air
Its something to see
But just like a chick who thinks her coochie doesnt stink
If she aint planning to do shit this summers eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
Aint steppin to you bitch I say to myself
Plus shes bumpin my music aint chasin no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it Im the male let her come to me
Could you repeat that again?
Let her come to me male sweater some degree fail
Fuck it pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Vipe-her
What is a brighter ass if she wants a computer lodged in her vagina?
Said my dick is an apple she said put it inside her
I said...
All day all day all night
You ask I stay the night
With you you say youre vile
Me too youre burning up
Im running...
All day all night
You feel my heat fire...
Feel feel feel feel feel my heat
Black out come to hands covered in blood
Motherfucking gloves and a shover stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat so that hoe mustve been dug
Cause it just died like ooh food coloring duh
So lets get turnt like a shish kebab twist it Ma
Like an Air Conditioning knob
We be great together
Dont care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait I guess its better late than never
You felt my heat rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on little mama youre hot enough to melt Ricks beat
Come jump in the water I bet you get your self esteem
From your persona
With an ass to match girl your body is lit
Youre striking Im a gas
Girl youre just gonna have to put
the mother chumps on the back burner
You got puns I got aspergers
Just let me rest my head in between that set of Ds
While I shred MCs like cheddar cheese
Thats just the thoroughbred me in me aint a better breed
My dog thinks so too look at my predigree
Ma the world is what I think of you
I think youre divine so I might swing on you
Im just kidding girl I wouldnt lift a finger or two
Unless its the middle finger to finger you
All day all day all night
You ask I stay the night
With you you say youre vile
Me too youre burning up
Im running...
Feel feel feel feel feel my heat
On the ones and twos threes and four the morning
Ricks in the cut like Neosporin what?
Hes mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
Were outtie five thousand
Who the fuck its my big dickso everybody get ready right fucking now
heatIts all bad now man its all bad
its all fucked up now
Yeah ha ha new shit hey yo
I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this but I will finish it
Comin up it never mattered was color you was
If you could spit then you could spit thats it thats what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight back packin
Cypherin fightin for life in this rap
for the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped
and you hyped cuz you last and you might whoop some ass
If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man
and you swallowed it when the unsigned hype column
at The Source was like the only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin a four was like
you were the shit now its like the least you get
three and a half now just means you a peice of shit
four and a half or five means you Biggie Jigga Nasor Benzino shit I dont eben think you realize
you playin with motherfuckers lives I done watched Dre
get fucked on The Chronic probably cuz I was on it
Now you fucked me outta my mics twice I let it slide
I said I wouldnt hold my fuckin breath to get a five
Shit I was right Ida fuckin died already tryin
I swear to God I never lie I bet thats why
you let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it I aint look at the shit we knew
Youd probly try to fuck us with Obie and  too
Fuck a relationship we through
No more Source with street credit them days is dead
Dres got A-Ks to Dave Mays head
Every issue theres an eight page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid hes just a fuckin waste of lead
on my pencil for me to write some shit this simple
So listen closely as I break it down and proceed
This old Gs bout to get smoked like rolled weed
You dont know me or my motherfuckin mother you motherfuckin punk
Put me on your fuckin cover just sell your little sell out mag
I aint mad I feel bad heres an ad heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit that you dont know about? ya
Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there
And to try to eat off him cuz you missed your boat
Your never gonna float bitch youre just too old
No wonder youre sore now lordy ya board now
Im pushin thirty you kickin fourtys door down
Bitch this is war now and youll never beat me
all you do is cheat me out of quotables but you know
that youll always see me on your TV
Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin
To see your video played once on BET
So he-he-he who has the last laugh?
Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff
kiss our ass-hole cracks well never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzinos wack
no matter how many times I say hes stan hell never blow jack
Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back
Look at your track record thats how far it goes back
Its extortion and Ray owns a prportion
so half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston
Bullyin and bossin caged like a slave theyve completely brainwashed him
And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest
fakest wannabe gangster in New York
And its pitiful cuz I never woulda said shit to you if youd kept your mouth shut
Bitch now what? hit it clue spit it slay
New shit exclusive yo lantern yo whoo kid
You know what to do with this use it
Im through this is stupid I cant believe I stooped to this
bullshit to do this...
And who you callin a bitch? Bitch. You owe me.
the sauce benzino dissSometimes I just feel like quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight why do I still write
Sometimes its hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
But Im still white sometimes I just hate life
Somethin aint right hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da it aint my fault
Great big eye balls my insides crawl
and I clam up I just slam shut
I just cant do it my whole manhoods
just been stripped Ive just been ripped
So I must then get on the bus and split
Man fuck this shit yo Im goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this  Mile Road
Im a man Ima make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back
 Mile Road And Im gone I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
Aint gonna follow no footsteps Im makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this  Mile Road
Im walkin these train tracks tryin to regain back
the spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant in the same pants
Tryin to chase rap gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan mommas got a new man
Poor little baby sister she dont understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother her mother and dad
Aint no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset cause I aint blew up yet
Its like I grew up but I aint grown me two nuts yet
Dont gotta rep my step dont got enough pep
The pressures too much man Im just tryin to do whats best
And I try sit alone and I cry
Yo I wont tell no lie not a moment goes by
That I dont pray to the sky please Im beggin you God
Please dont let me be pigeon-holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo Im tellin you dawg Im bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby Im never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And Ima be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own Ill make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this  Mile Road
Im a man Ima make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back
 Mile Road And Im gone I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
Aint gonna follow no footsteps Im makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this  Mile Road
You gotta live it to feel it you didnt you wouldnt get it
Or see what the big deal is why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
Its different its a certain significance a certificate
of authenticity youd never even see
But its everything to me its my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
whos incredible up on the same pedestal as me
But yet Im still unsigned havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go
Who must I show to bust my flow
Where must I go who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I aint havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet Im startin to doubt shit
Im feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum yo my clothes aint about shit
at the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And its cold tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like Im old stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up and one thing I dont want
is pity from no one the city is no fun
There is no sun and its so dark
Sometimes I feel like Im just bein pulled apart
from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends
Its enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot sometimes I just know not
what Im doin I just blow my head is a stove top
I just explode the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I dont got
But Ive learned its time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Aint no fallin on next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge suddenly its a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now Im free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from  Mile Road
Im a man Ima make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back
 Mile Road And Im gone I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
Aint gonna follow no footsteps Im makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this  Mile Road
 mile funkymixMotherfuckers -
say that Im foolish I only talk about jewels bling bling
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See Im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin I made somethin doin
what I do through and through and
I give you the news - with a twist its just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
Mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No hes not around - now how that sound to ya jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?
I help them see they way through it - not you
Cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
Since Im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I aint no politician but Ill kick it with em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits Ill wear it
But if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
But theres a huge interference - theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
Maybe its hatred I spew maybe its food for the spirit
Maybe its beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But Im debated disputed hated and viewed in America
as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didnt experiment?
Now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldnt do good at marriage!
Ha ha! And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go - hes
And Im the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass its just the

about anything anything? Anything ANYTHING!
I had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
Gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent bring dollars in
By the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
Do not step to me - Im awkward I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
Could not stress to me I wasnt grown specially on nights
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor - thirty years my senior
My childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it - multi before I die nigga
No lie just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
See Im a poet to some a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that aint the case see its a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shadys as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See its easy as cake simple as whistlin Dixie
while Im wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons take a bath with the Catholics
in holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer
Im a motherfuckin spiteful DELIGHTFUL eyeful
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you
What did I do? huh? Im just a kid from the gutter
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers cause Im a muhfuckin

Little Hellions kids feelin rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin like prisoners helpless
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary vision of scary
Could start a revolution pollutin the airwaves
A rebel so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin my ass
And its a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well Im back
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then Im gonna
Enter in endin up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
Im interesting the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Heres my ten cents my two cents is free
A nuisance who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said This looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
A-tisket a-tasket I go tit for tat with
Anybody whos talkin this shit that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You  year old baldheaded fag blow me
You dont know me youre too old let go
Its over nobody listen to techno
Now lets go just gimme the signal
Ill be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean Im disgusting
But its just me Im just obscene
No Im not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
Theres a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
Itll be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said This looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me

without me album version explicitEminem
talking gibberish
translation
so you can suck my dick if you dont like my shitcause i was high when i wrote so suck my dick.
Two pills i pop till my pupils swell up like two pennies
im Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
a young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats cant chew trough the last pants
Im like a mummy at night fightin with bright lightnin
frightened with  little white Vicadin Pills bitin him
im like a fuckin was in the hospital lost
stingin the fuck outta everything i came across in the halls
i light a candle and place it up on a mantle
grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
so when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds hurtin
Swiftyits just to late
EminemCause once youre hung from the drapes its curtains
Swifty McBay
Im an instigator  slug pentrator
degrading creating murders to kill haters
accused for every crime known thru the equator
they knew i did it for having blood on my gators
my weed ll hit youre chest like a double barrel gauge
im like a black grenade that ll blow up in youre face
with a fifth of me when i guzzle Remi i do shit on purpose
you never hear me say forgive me
im snatching every penny
i gotta be that way nigga face it
that weed i sold to you brigade laced it
you high and i make the president get a facelift
niggas just afraid handing me their bracelets
chilling in the lab wasted
im the type that ll drink Kahlua and Gin-throw up on the mic
your life is ruined you get socked right on site
and even at the Million Man March we gon fight
Eminem
So you can suck my dick if you dont like my shitcause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick.

Dirty Harry
Strangling rappers to the point they cant yell

a big chinese nigga screaming yo yo!

run up in church and smack the preacher while hes preachin
take a swing at the deacon
The Kon Artis
I used to tell cats i sold weed and weights
i was straight until i got caught sellin them shaped
im ignorant with the intent to snatch youre rent
i got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendents daughter my brains out of order
ive bin a con artist since i was swimmin in water
in Cahoots with this nigga called Fall Out Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb special delivery
i signed to a local label for fun
say i got cancer get dropped take the advancement and run
ride by you in the rain while you carry youre son
call you house and hang up on you for not givin me none
born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
got a reputation for havin niggas run up they funds
used to be the type of nigga that was full of someones
Til i met youre fat mama now im rollin in dough
Eminem

better not let up better not let them breath
last shot give it all you got
try to turn me down b-tch get f-cked with the volume nob
f-ck all you snobs
hoes I hope all you rott
 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought
and you wanna menage a trois you twats
f-ck that Id rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
get as rowdy as Roesthlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leech stuck in a vacuum your only nothin but a whole lot of suckin
goin on in rap
yeah but Im home
Bad to the bone
Back in the zone
Let him alone
You dont wanna go eggin him on
Itll never be my chair that your on
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
otherwords theres no heir to the throne
when I die so does hip hop
hitchcock better sh-t bitch ass got a zip locked in a bag
you fags aint been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
Keep bloggin while I mind boggle in my zone like im in the twilight dog.
Get off my bone this is my mic doggonit and I like hoggin it
flow so wet Imma take this beat tobogganing
Im water logging it Im sogging it
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplex it on cement like Im on some straight outta compton sh-t
take this d-ck and chomp on it
Im so bad I can b-tch slap a back handed compliment
jack ass eat a donkey d-ck
the game I just about conquered it like Donkey Kong
Im bonkers bitch Im the king of this honkey sh-t I reign supreme in this honkey sh-t
no sense screaming and arguing
makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in
you think you ball well I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omlette
but you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch Im as bat sh-t as Ozzy its obvious
you can tell I go right off the bat
no pun intended but come any closer Ill bite off your head
tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
Im just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
I give as much as a flying f-ck as that superman dude
guess I just do what you cant do or make you look stupid and bamboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the f-ck outta hells kitchen
I came to cock block like a square f-cking male chicken
yeah its shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cause Im as despicable as Daffy Duck when Im spittin
haha recovery
despicable freestyleMay I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up
Were gonna have a problem here
Yall act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin her ass worse than before
They first were divorced throwin her over furniture Ahh
Its the return of the oh wait no way youre kidding
He didnt just say what I think he did did he
And said nothing you idiots
Dr. Dres dead hes locked in my basement Haha
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady Im sick of him
Look at him walkin around grabbin his you know what
Flippin to you know who yeah but hes so cute though
Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than whats goin on in your parents bedrooms Eh-eh-eh
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose but cant
But its cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
And if Im lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And thats the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is
Of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they got the Discovery Channel dont they
We aint nothing but mammals well some of us are cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope Eww
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose sing the and it goes
Im Slim Shady yes Im the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up
Cause Im Slim Shady yes Im the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up

Half of you critics cant even stomach me let alone stand me
But Slim what if you win wouldnt it be weird
Why so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and
And hear em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
Yeah hes cute but I think hes married to Kim hehe
I should download her audio on MP
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD Ahh
Im sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And theres a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me who just dont give a fuck like me
Who dress like me walk talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me
Cause Im Slim Shady yes Im the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up
Cause Im Slim Shady yes Im the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up
Im like a head trip to listen to cause Im only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of yall
And I dont gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it Rip I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums its funny
Cause at the rate Im going when Im thirty
Ill be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses while Im jackin off with Jergens
And Im jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isnt workin
In every single person theres a slim shady lurkin
who could be workin at Burger King spittin on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling screamin I dont give a fuck
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time loud as you can hows it go
Im Slim Shady yes Im the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Shady please stand up
Please stand up please stand up

Yo Yo Yo Back to me Back to meI can keep that beat?
Yo Weed Lacer  burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary had to ditch the mercury tracer
Im on some lok ishIm fed up wit the being broke ish
Im not to joke wit
Bitch I dont sell crack I smoke it
Having a coke-fit and goin through withdrawls daily
Shoot up with Mesciline Infront of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted Im disgusted at all my habits
Too many asprin tablets empty medicine cabinets
Loosing battles to wack rappers cause Im always too blunted
Walkin up in the cypher smokin talkin about Who won it?
Thug and crook every drug in the book Ive done it
My s at your brain is that your chain? Run it
Crews die from an over-dose of your exessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular battle rap manufacturer
Stole your momas Acura wrecked it then sold it back to her
Right right right ! ! ! Ding ! ! !
Cruise In nike jackets Escaped from Psyciatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
I might be back Trick
So barricade your Entrance put up some extra fences
A woman beater wanted for repeated sex offenses Ooh
Chasin Dips
.Take em on long vacation trips
Kidnappin em and trappin em in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit Laughter
Mama dont you cry your sons too far gone
Im so high I dont even know what label Im on
Im messed up I feel just like an over worked plumber
Im sick of the crap whats Jack Kevorkians phone number? Ha. Hot
wake up showYo if you could just for one minute
Or one split second in time forget everything
Everything that bothers you all your problems
Everything and follow me
If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand it passes through it
If I can grasp it and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through em to make you put your ass into it
And thats when you hit the roof because you cant sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it your movements become fast and fluent
Youre mashin to it moshing until youre black and bluish
Youre acting foolish this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True its chaotic but its got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight so make it last and you better just
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
Cause when we descend together we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync if youll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once I mean if you could let shit go
Relax take a breath and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make em feel the feeling that Im feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night wont end til I get finished
So close the shades makin sure no light gets in it
The skys the limit tonight because the nights infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like whats spinnin
His life was spinnin the whole entire night just spinnin
Like lifes beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin in it
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it we wont never let it go Go
You better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
lose yourself original demo versionBeen holdin this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind
me
But its so hard to escape
Oh lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me awwaaayyyy
Away far away to better days.
Have you ever been hated or discriminated
against? I have Ive been protested and
demonstrated against.  Picket signs for my
wicked rhymes. Look at the times. Sick is the
mind of the motha f___in kid thats behind 
all this commotion. Emotions run deep as
oceans explodin. Tempers flaring from
parents just blow em off and keep goin.  Not
takin nothin from no one give em hell long
as Im breathin. Keep kickin a__ in the
mornin an takin names in the evening. 
Leavem with a taste as sour as vinegar in they
mouth. See they can trigger me but they never
figure me out.  Look at me now I bet ya
probably sick of me now. Aint you mama Ima
make you look so ridiculous now.Keep tellin
yourself that you was a mom.  But how dare
you try to take what you didnt help me to get.
You selfish b____ I hope you f___in burn in hell
for this s___.  Remember when Ronnie died
and you said you wished it was me? Wellguess what I am dead. Dead to you as can be.
Been holdin this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind
me
But its so hard to escape
Oh lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me awwaaayyyy
Away far away to better days
I got some skeletons in my closet and I dont
know if no one knows it. So before they thrown
me inside my coffin and close it  Ima expose
it. Ill take you back to  before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin CD.  I was a babymaybe I was just a couple of months. My
f__got father must have had his panties up in a
bunch  cuz he split. I wonder if he even
kissed me goodbye. No I dont on second
thought I just f___in wished he would die.  I
look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leavin her
side. Even if I hated Kim I grit my teeth and
Id try  to make it work with her at least for
Hailies sake. I maybe made some mistakes
but Im only human. But Im man enough to
face them today.  What I did was stupid no
doubt it was dumb but the smartest s___ I did
was take them bullets out of that gun.  Cuz
ida killed em s___ I would have shot Kim an
him both. Its my life Id like to welcome yall
to The Eminem Show.

Now I would never dis my own mama just to
get recognition. Take a second to listen for you
think this record is dissin  But put yourself in
my position. Just try to envision witnessin
your Mama poppin prescription pills in the
kitchen  b____in that someones always goin
throuh her purse and s___s missin. Going
through public housing systems victim of
Munchausens syndrome. My whole life I was
made to believe I was sick when I wasnt til I
grew up now I blew up. It makes you sick to
ya stomach  doesnt it? Wasnt it the reason
you made that CD for me Ma? So you could
try to justify the way you treated me Ma? 
But guess what yer gettin older now and its
cold when your lonely. An Nathans getting
up so quick hes gonna know that your
phoney.  And Hailies getting so big now you
should see her shes beautiful. But youll never
see her she wont even be at your funeral. 
See what hurts me the most is you wont
admit you was wrong. b____ do ya song. Keep
tellin yourself that you was a mom.

im aliveMotherfers
Say that Im foolish
I only talk about jewels
Bling bling
Do you fools
Listen to music or
Do you just skim
Through it?
See Im influenced
By the ghetto you ruined
That same dude
You gave nothin
I made somethin doin
What I do through
And through and
I give you the news
With a twist
Its just his
Ghetto point-of-view
The renegade
You been afraid
I penetrate pop culture
Bring em a lot closer
To the block where they
Pop toasters
And they live
With they moms
Got dropped roasters
From botched robberies
Niggaz crotched over
Mommys knocked up
Cause she wasnt
Watched over
Knocked down
By some clown
When child support knocked
No hes not around
Now how that
Sound to ya?
Jot it down
I bring it
Through the ghetto
Without ridin round
Hidin down duckin strays
From frustrated youths
Stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine
That fed up my day
How you rate music
That thugs with
Nothin relate to it?
I help them see they way
Through it not you
Cant step in my pants
Cant walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth
You lose your tie
And your shirt
Since Im in a position
To talk to these kids
And they listen
I aint no politician
But Ill kick it
With em a minute
Cause see they
Call me a menace
And if the shoe fits
Ill wear it
But if it dont
Then yall will
Swallow the truth
Grin and bear it
Now whos these
King of these rude
Ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title
Put the youth in hysterics
Usin his music to steer it
Sharin his views
And his merits
But theres
A huge interference
Theyre sayin
You shouldnt hear it
Maybe its hatred I spew
Maybe its food
For the spirit
Maybe its beautiful music
I made for you
To just cherish
But Im debated disputed hated
And viewed in America
As a motherfin drug addict
Like you didnt experiment?
Now now thats when
You start to stare at
Whos in the mirror
And see yourself
As a kid again
And you get embarrased
And I got nothin to do
But make you look
Stupid as parents
You fin do-gooders
Too bad you couldnt
Do good at marriage
Ha ha
And do you
Have any clue
What I had to do
To get here?
I dont think you do
So stay tuned and
Keep your ears
Glued to the stereo
Cause here we go
Hes
Jigga joint Jigga-chk-Jigga
And Im the sinister
Mr. Kiss-My-As
Its just the

I had to hustle
My back to the wall
Ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with
A lot of lint not a cent
Gotta vent
Lot of innocent of lives
Lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin?
Gotta pay rent
Bring dollars in
By the bodega
Iron under my coat
Feelin braver
Doo-rag
Wrappin my waves up
Pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
Im awkward
I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan
My momma wasnt home
Could not stress to me
I wasnt grown
Specially on nights
I brought somethin home
To quiet the
Stomach rumblings
My demeanor
Thirty years my senior
My childhood
Didnt mean much
Only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics
Raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it
Multi before I die nigga
No lie just know
I chose my own fate
I drove by the
Fork in the road
And went straight
See Im a poet to some
A regular
Modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the
King of these
Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture
In which of that
As they paint me
As a monger of hate and
Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that aint the case
See its a matter of taste
We as a people decide
If Shadys as bad
As they say he is
Or is he the latter
A gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat
Who they can
Be mad at today
See its easy as cake
Simple as whistlin Dixie
While Im wavin the pistol
At sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons
Take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water
No wonder they try
To hold me under longer
Im a motherfin spiteful
Delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube
Motherfers hate to like you
What did I do?
Huh?
Im just a kid
From the gutter
Makin this butter
Off these bloodsuckers
Cause Im a muhfin

There you go
Yeah
Yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have Ive been protested and demostrated against
Picket signs for my wickid rhymes look at the times
Sick as the mind of the mother fucking kid thats behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give em hell long as Im breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
Look at me now I betcha prolly sick of me now
Aint you mama Ima make you look so ridiculous now
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
One More Time
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
Ha!
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Ima expose it Ill take you back to 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I dont on second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailey and I couldnt picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim I grin my teeth and I try to make it work
With her atleast for Hailies sake I maybe made some mistakes
But Im only human but Im man enough to face them today

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someones always going through her purse when shits missing
Going through public housing systems victim of munchhausen syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt
Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it?
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me ma?
But guess what your getting older now and its cold when your lonely
And Nathans growing up so quick hes gonna know that your phoney
And Hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral hahaha
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song keep telling yourself that you was a mum
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
You selfish bitch I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet
One More Time
Im sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight Im cleaning out my closet

cleaning out my closet rukiz blendBetter In Time Remix Lyrics Eminem
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well Im gone but Im trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry
Cause youre scared I aint there?
Daddys with you in your prayers
No more crying wipe them tears
Daddys here no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it we gon do it
Laney uncles crazy aint he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Were all we got in this world
When it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze
I know its confusing you
Daddys always on the move mammas always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I dont see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream
Tupac
Was it the liquor that makes me act blind times that Im with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggaz tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
Im sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
Im on tour but now my bedrooms an open door
So it got me thinkin what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb eager to please
a lil trick on a mission tryin to get him a peace
Me and my niggaz is thug niggaz former known drug dealers
We dont love bitches and believe they dont love niggaz
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Cant turn a hoe into a housewife baby
Leona Lewis
Thought I couldnt live without you
Its gonna hurt when it heals too
Oooh yeahItll all get better in time
Even though I really love you
Im gonna smile because I deserve too ooooohItll all get better in time
Bridge
Since theres no more you and me No more you and me
This time I let you go so I can be free
And Live my life how it should beNo No No No No No
No matter how hard it is
I will be fine without you
Yes I Will
Thought I couldnt live without you
Its gonna hurt when it heals too
OoohItll all get better in time
Even though I really loved you
Im gonna smile cos I deserve too yes I doItll all get better in time
Thought I couldnt live without you
Its gonna hurt when it heals too yeaaaah Ooooh oooooh Itll all get better in time
Even though I really loved you
Going to smile cos I deserve too Ooooooh Itll all get better...
eminem blendSo i changed huh
You got a phonePick it up call me
How come we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe dont barely keep in touch at allAnd I dont even feel the same love when we hug no moAnd I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin nowAfter all the years weve been downAint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe family aint a damn thing change unless its you
We were so youngSo full of life and vibranceSide by side wherever you was ridin I wentSo close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shitWhen Ronnie died you was right by my sideWith a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyesAnd a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside itYou even had the same type of childhood I didSometimes I just wanna know whyIs it that you succumbed to yoursAnd mine I survived itYou ran the streets I nine to fived itWe grew up grew apart this time went by usThen I blew up to both yours and mine surprisesNow I feel the vibe I just cant describe itMuch as your pride tries to hide itYoure cold your touch is just like iceAnd your eyes is the look of resentmentI can sense it and I dont like it
How come we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe dont barely keep in touch at allAnd I dont even feel the same love when we hug no moAnd I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin nowAfter all the years weve been downAint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe family aint a damn thing change unless its you
It was my dream at first to be all spittin the verseOn my own album with a deal but shit got worseSo I came out I woulda killed a nigga firstFore I let him disrespect meOr check me up with somethin worseSome bitch that I wasnt withI woulda hit her to quitBut you were plain talkin to herAnd tell her she was the shitI told you dont get involved with herYou were smoking the cronc with herComing outa the bar with herStumblin half drunkLike yall was husband or wife or somthinBut me catchin her kissin other guysMustve hurt your pride or somthinCause you wolf I fit them after peopleLike you want it with meWhen all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shiftyAnd lyrics is the fans and all the shit that I produceYou actin like I aint your manAnd lyin like she cant be looseBut I am really your friendIm just trying to tell you the truthDont hate the game or the playaThe one thats changin is you
How come we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe dont barely keep in touch at allAnd I dont even feel the same love when we hug no moAnd I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin nowAfter all the years weve been downAint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe family aint a damn thing change unless its you
We gettin lonely at the top
cuz my homie had to stop
now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
so they gossip on the porch get ta speakin all rude
fools i used to rap with all expect magic
like my finger get ta snappin and poof it just happen
but Proof its just actin at the party were stoned
shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
see the devil in your grin since the ghetto we been friends
forever real intelligence thats forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise
How come when you talk its with bitter respite
And how come its my fault for what you did with your life
and every time i go to hear you and play you look away
we barely embrace you cant even look me in my face
How come we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe dont barely keep in touch at allAnd I dont even feel the same love when we hug no moAnd I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin nowAfter all the years weve been downAint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe family aint a damn thing change unless its you
how comeLord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what Ive done
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
head popped off head popped off head popped off head popped off head popped off
My momma dont want me the next thing I know Im gettin dropped off
gettin dropped off gettin dropped off gettin dropped off gettin dropped off
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
their front porch their front porch their front porch their front porch
But they didnt want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn
elses lawn elses lawn elses lawn
Till somebody finally took me in my great aunt uncle Edna n Charles
Edna n Charles Edna n Charles Edna n Charles Edna n Charles
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
sang this song sang this song sang this song sang this song
It went a little something like mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just dont understand understand
And by the way wheres my dad?
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds
Predominantly predominantly everythings always predominantly
Predominantly white predominantly black
But what about me where does that leave me
Well I guess that Im between predominantly both of em
I think if I hear that fuckin word again Imma scream
While Im projectile vomiting what do I look like a comedian to you?
Do you think that Im kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute shit dont answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit it sucks bullshitWoe is me there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow hes always drownin in
From the dad he never had and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man Id hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I cant imagine it that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds
Evil deeds while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these deamons
I never had any of this shit planned ma please believe
I dont wanna be Satans spawn never got the chance to say Im sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
This Santa Clause why you not comin this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life aint a fairytale Im about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me theres people everywhere
I dont even know what it feel like they know me cuz Im in this ferris wheel
And all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now doe see doe now curtains up the show must go now
Ring around the rosie the shows over you can all go home now
But the curtain just dont close for me this aint how fame is supposed to be
Wheres the switch I could just turn off and on this aint what I chose to be
So please god give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass  back the baton the cameras on myself is gone
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds
Oh!
Last one baby...

Slim is in the house simmer down there sister
Bound to get you dizzy cause he gets as busy as a
Bee baby you can throw a frizbee in a blizzard
Hell catch it in his teeth what is he? Hes a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And Im pretty sure it isnt Bisquick is it?
Now baby dont forget to bring your lipstick with ya
I want a kiss fore I blow this bitch to smithe-
-reens get the guillotines this is a situ-
-ation thats critical as Dre spins his uh
Turntables and he cuts a record like a scissor
Cheka chicka checka chicka cheka-cheka chicka
Who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and its six o-
-clock in the morning less you want to get some dessert
got u slippinMy teas gone cold Im wondering why I
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
and I cant see at all
And even if I could itll all be graybut your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so badits not so bad.
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
and I cant see at all
And even if I could itll all be graybut your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so badits not so bad.
Dear Slim I wrote you but you still aint calling
I left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn you must not-a got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
but anyways fuck it whats been up? Man hows your daughter?
My girlfriends pregnant too Im bout to be a father
If I have a daughter guess what Ima call her?
Ima name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too Im sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didnt want him
I know you probably hear this everyday but Im your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too that shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this man hit me backjust to chat truly yours your biggest fan
This is Stan
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
and I cant see at all
And even if I could itll all be graybut your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so badits not so bad.
Dear Slim you still aint called or wrote I hope you have a chance
I aint mad - I just think its fucked up you dont answer fans
If you didnt wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didnt have to but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
Thats my little brother man hes only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for youfour hours and you just said No.
Thats pretty shitty man - youre like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do
I aint that mad though I just dont like being lied to
Remember when we met in London - you said if Id write you
you would write back - see Im just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day I drift away and put em on
cause I dont really got shit else so that shit helps when Im depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
Its like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriends jealous cause I talk about you 
But she dont know you like I know you Slim no one does
She dont know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man Ill be the biggest fan youll ever lose
Sincerely yours Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too
My teas gone cold Im wondering why I
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
and I cant see at all
And even if I could itll all be graybut your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so badits not so bad.
stan live at radio Woah uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping em and like back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasnt
It bes the brothers representin the Dirty Dozen

And check out my man he goes by the name of um er…
Slim Shady brain dead like Jim Brady
Im an M- you little like that Kim lady
Im buzzin Dirty Dozen naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You aint gon sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it fuck it while we coming out in the open
Im doing acid crack smack coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers Im an alcoholic
Hi Marshall!
I have a disease and they dont know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
Cause Im coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch Im coming out swingin so fast itll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding just ask DeShaun Holton
Ill slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming Fuck the world like Tupac
I just dont give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking telling your boys that Im on crack
I just dont give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just dont give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon get stuck stoned and snuffed
Cause I just dont give a fuck
Im nicer than Pete but Im on a search to crush a milkbone
Im everlasting I melt vanilla ice like silicone
Im ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
Im colder than snow season when its  below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin this is the sneak preview
Ill diss your magazine and still wont get a weak review
Ill make your freak leave you smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady Eminem was the old initials
Extortion snortin supportin abortion
Pathological liar blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
Impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
Half animal half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming Fuck the world like Tupac
I just dont give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking telling your boys that Im on crack

So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack

But see me on the street and duck
Cause you finna get stuck stoned and snuffed
Cause I just dont give a fuck
Somebody let me out this limousine! Im a caged demon
On stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
Im convinced Im a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead I dont need a second opinion
Fuck droppin a jewel Im flippin a sacred treasure
Ill bite your motherfuckin style just to make it fresher
I cant take the pressure Im sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin while Im washin dishes
In school I never said much too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam thats when my face grayed
Went to gym in th grade raped the womens swim team
Dont take me for a joke Im no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
Im going up over the curb driving on the median
Finally made it home but I dont got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming Fuck the world like Tupac
I just dont give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back

opens up his jaws to say somethin to rattle my name off

so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
till i peel the pain off
i never been shot but i think me and  musta been cut from the same cloth

when they tried to rush him and lost
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it

what the fuck am i sposed to do?
haha
yo we out
monkey see monkey doIve drowned in high from the ashes now I cant recall your laughter
The smoke of every single grasp but ends of whats left over
And the lights in every broken blown our window
Screaming laughing
I love to feel the course hang out
This is our revival
interludeWarning this shits gon be rated R restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? Its self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma Bitch you got a sick kid
Arrested molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
Im Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
Murder murder Redrum
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated till my stress is elevated
How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?
Illiterate illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littleer
Smoke a blunt while Im titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Yall thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didnt Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon fit in her
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I lace tunes Im out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits dip shits
Doing whip pits passed out like Sanford snip pits
Wheres the weed I wanna tamper with it
Ima let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her cant forget it
Fuck it maybe Im a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what Im on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch what the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip theres a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mamas chapped lips
Slap hips support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
Im just joking is Dirty Dozens really dust smoking?
If all your shits missing than probably one of us broke in
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
My heads ringing like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
Im out the game put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like Oh this is good who sing this?
Slim Shady his tape is dope I love it
Its rugged but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
It was predicted by a medic
Id grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic but I dont think this headaches ever vanishing
Panicking I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen Manaquin posted stiffer than a statue
I think Im dying God is that you?
Somebody help me before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB they dont support no hip hop
They say thats where it ends the closest they gon come is Tupac
Its politics its all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

While your whole crew treat us like Gs you best believe this
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape it aint no secret
That your shit sounds fake you cant stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
Im like Two-Face Im painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells how I gotta bend em like route canals
I erase all trails somethin farther from gettin bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself you might as well
Be within a  to life sentence on linkin trials
Horrified and keep on frontin repentin and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swifts around vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape how?

Last week this old man I had to blast
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady hung her neck by a Didnt realize it was my grandmother til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost  pounds I aint been eatin like I should

Rob this little boy in his fuckin paper route
Throwin bottles at day care centers and yell EVERYBODY GET OUT!

No one no ones iller than me
Its Bizarre Kid straight from the 
No one no one is iller than me

Nobody better test me cuz I dont wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch dick freshly
New Lugz give the crew hugs guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin -bottles like the fuckin Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth crack open a six
Im on my seventh -ball now I gotta take a piss
Im hollerin at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was
Im always takin someone elses girl like Cool J does
They probably dont be packin anyways do they Fuzz?
We walked up stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin felon headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin shit will get you your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady aint nobody iller than me
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin the most classic threads
Flashin bread roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs you can get til that ass get red
You can get til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him Swift you get him and him
Ill get him and him leave the other two for my nigga Eminem

Got fired for jumpin the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin GET THE COPS QUICK!
And got drop kicked now she screamin Stop it...

Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your niche youre just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the E before the D because thats all you on
You on Pacs dick bitch you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of mothafucker ruins  deals that another nigga got you they didnt see skills
And I aint playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
Its just the real niggas aint buying that shit you put out
Obie
Doe Rae Me but we dont sing motherfuckers
So Murda Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then RnB coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green dont fuck with them triple beams
Yous a muther fucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action Pacs assasination
Def jam grabbed him told him reinact him youll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur dont enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reinacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in detroit motherfucker
Eminem

Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you aint shit but a bitch fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renisanse sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect

You niggas can scream holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse
Proof
Slim didnt send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones
Whats wrong? didnt think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness yall aint caught the concept
Youre talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatning at the boss youre gonna see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust
Kuniva
Do I gotta get my nigga bugz punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Whos behind ya? Caddillac Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
Thats right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pacs songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your mockavelli get your own identity
Eminem

Eminem No honey you guys are the same size hahaha
doe rae mePsst hey listen
I love my job
It makes me feel like superman
Can you fly I can wanna see
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congress
Has been a problem for the longest I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really shouldve fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark
Theres a ray
Theres a light
Theres a hope
Theres a spark
But when planets collide
Theyll never see eye to eye
Until they decide
To set the differences aside
And this is why
Only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead
And feel the vibe because
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldnt take lyrics so serious It might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
Its stupid aint it I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot pointy nosed bleached blonde
Cuz I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like
Ill be here when yall are gone re-building
World revolving still evolving still Slim
How many kids will copy probably millions
But Ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
Alarmin rate common denominate
Add it up and youll see thats why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make Slim youre great
But wait cant you see Im only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cause man I see it feel it live it but its inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you aint
But they dont understand that Ive been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you cant just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And its such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust
Im only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I to a place that you cant see
But I believe you can fly
I dont mean nobody harm Im just partyin
Im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic
So let me entertain you
stimulate non album versionYeah
Definitely definitely definitely definitely definately K-mart
Yeah yeah
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
hence if I should draw out a line any fences
if so to what extent if any should I go?
cause its getting expensive
being on the other side of the court room on the defensive
they say I cause extensive psycholgical nerve damage to the brain
when I go to lengths this far at other peoples expenses
I say youre all just too god damn sensitive
its censorship and its downright blasphemous
lets end this shit now cause I wont stand for this
and Christopher Reeves wont sit for this neither
and lets clear this up too I aint got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those  cent stickers
on my refrigerator right next to Darth Vader
and Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like its my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him off in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman I killed Super... Man
and how ironic that Id be the bad guy kryptonite
the green chronic
Cause i aint got no legs or no brain
nice to meet you
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man
Now in the bible it says
thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course its intercourse and it bisexual sex
which isnt as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before during or after performing the act of that which
is normally reffered to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today kids
in a more derogatory way
but whos to say whats fair to say and what not to say
let ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre what up?
I got a question if i may yea
is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend yea
and watch his butt butt when he tees off yea
but but i aint done yet
in football a quarterback yells out hut hut
while he reaches in another grown mans ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
his teeny tiny little round hiney
and he didnt mean it but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and I dont need to go into any more details
but what if he pictured it as a females butt
is that gay? I just need to clear things up
til then Ill just walk around with a manly strut because...
Cause i aint got no legs or no brain
nice to meet you
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man
You find me offensive
I find you offensive...
shit this is the same verse I just did this
when am I gonna come to my good senses?
probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
my spider senses telling me Spider-Man is nearby
and my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop ass canister
god damnit Dre wheres the god damn beat yea anyway
anyway I dont know how else to put it
this is the only thing that Im good at
I am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
demonic yep yep dont worry Im on it I got it
high-fived Nick Lechey stuck a pin in Jessicas head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
and flew my ass straight back to the Neverland Ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwhich
and I dont even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didnt say shit
Cause i aint got no legs or no brain
nice to meet you
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man

People are lookin for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin their noses in shit that isnt none of their business
I never asked cared gave a fuck or wanted opinions
Now Im in the position that I dont wanna be in - shit

So Im tellin you right now - motherFUCK a Limp Bizkit

He aint say shit the whole time me and
Whitey was beefin see he chill
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
Id have never involved my crew if it wasnt for Pupils
Peoples whatever your backpackin cypherin name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and
Ida never involved you but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and Ill admit I had a few in me
Fuck it I roasted you I aint mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released it leaked
Ida never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV now look whos mentionin me
That little fuckin weasel DJ Lethal on MTV
After I gave you props in that song you on national TV
Talkin bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?

Whats wrong? You scared and Fred you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin sissy up on stage screamin how people hate you
They dont hate you
They just think youre corny since Christina played you
And how dare you motherfuckers that try to diss me back
Thats a sissy act and dont call me kissin my ass
Cause I swear to God this aint just a song Im tryin to pre-warn you
Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg Im swingin on you!
Motherfuckers must think cause Im in trouble with the law

And we all knowwww - we all know hah
How fuckin cowards rollll - keep rollin rollin rollin

That goes for all of my dogs from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man til Im hoist away
in my coffin Ill never soften no matter how often Im tested
Ill never give a fuck I wont never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no nope
Next time Ill know when someones copyin off me

I stick up my middle finger he sticks up his finger hey!

Fuck Christina but meaner
So from doin a song with Method to beggin to get accepted
Im peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal dont forget what I said
Im fuckin you up punk youre dead! Dont think that Im playin
And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know youre sayin fuck D-
Only not to our face under your breath to yourselves
You little - girrrrls - motherfuckin females
Why do you act this way? - Why do yall act this way huh?

keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all knowwww - now we all know the truth
How fuckin cowards rollll - keep rollin rollin rollin
In-fuckin-dent mes and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out

Now I dont ask nobody to share my
beliefs to be involved in my beefs
Im a man I can stand on my feet
So if you dont wanna be in em all I ask

And I will see you too oh and by the way Fred
That wasnt an accident
I didnt mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha.
girls limp bizkit dissOnce again its the sinister cynical minister Shady
Grip the knife to Superman hes a dinister Amy
Administer of the pain just finished huffin the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin because it aint
Anything in his way his enemies he just slays his venom he sprays breeches like pins of energy rays
Menacing stares he glares making the hairs all on the back of your neck stand like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep hes a tarantula gargantuan yeah Angela so I command ya to start dancin
Part Manson part Hannibal part mechanical sharp
Throwin animal parts at Scarlet Johanson
Into my gas chamber yeah gangster my ass
Hes got his fangs to your neck hes set to strangle your ass hater youre facin the task raider
Hes chasin your ass hes got his face in the mask and bloodstains on his glass table
Im checking the exposure of o-dosing me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while Im dozing off overdosing
Windows opening shutting doors opening closing
I think theres a ghost too much hydrocordone and codeine
I was only sposed to swallow a half I took the whole thing
Im not joking
I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink Im standing over the sink posing
Myself self loathing cause Im on the brink mostly
I dont wanna think thisll make everything rosy
Beverly sings screams while Im severing three tosies
Totally frozen while I close in
Im yodeling Rosy! Wont you come out to play? 
Illusions wasting time cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofins in my syrup and stirred em
You never heard him
Like this so dont encourage him the neurosurgeon
Coke beers and lyrics worsen
The kinda person to give Katy Kuric to Kirsten
 spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turned him
Invincible he emerged and
Took over the world and
Reeled in all the children
Lured em into the buildin and killed em
Buried em in the mulch and mildew
And he will do what he feels
And still can spin straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk mulch into Tylenol three pills
The real Slim Shadys entered the buildin
Its nothin but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch Mildred hes Ill with it
He still shouldnt be healed
Theres no one as sick as he MCsll still get freakin seed on the grill then

You can hear em holla Goon Squad in this bitch

Homie its been a long time comin and Im straight with that
Marshall call me ? and laced the track
This the beat you hear it bangin he produced it himself
My bad almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick head of the Good Squad
And gangsta been bangin the underground since  were bangin
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me you just didnt know it was me
All the treacherous evil deeds of the D you ever see
Pickin that kid up in the game I just wasnt chasin the fame
I been chasin the paper product and givin lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin a murder rap
And my boy holdin me up Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem Detroit back in the house

Ayo Em you ever need one of these weapons come get it
gtFrom now on every beef that you get in homie Im in it

So its evident its time for Trick to get it fast
The public see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldnt keep up
Got a fanbase thats bigger than an average star
Im satisfied with it bein my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I aint sayin the shit that Im sayin so girls can feel me
Only speakin on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs we embrace the love
And beat the hell outta anyone that fucks with us
 Chorus - Eminem 
Wheres my gangstas and all my thugs?

detroit rap cityWhatever
Dre just let it run
Hey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
Just shut up and listen Hey yo
Hey yo.
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this ... on this earth
And since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin these sentences gettin this stress
thats been eatin me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully peacefully...
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when Im eatin or feedin my daughter
To not come and speak to me speak to me... I dont know you
And no I dont owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
Im not Mr. NSync Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr. Friendly I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty...
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Im liftin you  feet  feet... in the air
I dont care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of arguin of arguin...
I dont mean to be mean but thats all I can be its just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant
And Oh its his lyrical content -
That song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me finger at me...
So I point one back at em but not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
When you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
With the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn on Marilyn... and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where its at
Middle America now its a tragedy
Now its so sad to see an upper class city
Havin this happenin this happenin...
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way rap this way...
But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and its burnin and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Im so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top on My Name Is
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rocknroll stations
And I just do not got the patience got the patience...
To deal with these cocky caucasians
who think Im some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk with an accent
And grab on my balls so they always keep askin
The same fuckin questions fuckin questions...
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in
The why the who what when the where and the how
Til Im grabbin my hair and Im tearin it out ahhh
Cause they drivin me crazy me crazy... I cant take it
Im racin Im pacin I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get
But I cant take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin by itNo I wont sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole Im glad
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am

Uh-uh! Then whys your face red? Man you wasted!
Well since age twelve Ive felt like Im someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lees tits off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot next semester Ill be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler stapled his nuts to a stack of paper Ow-w-w-w!
Walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extra-terrestrial running over pedestrians
In a spaceship while theyre screamin at me Lets just be friends!
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do Damn!
I told her Id grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her Oh thank you!
You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans Ahh! Ahhhhh!
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph Dude can I get your autograph?
So I signed it Dear Dave thanks for the support asshole!

Ill have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive Huh yup!
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka dare me to drive? Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide Whoops!
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk Hahh-too
I spit when I talk Ill fuck anything that walks Cmere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How ya gonna breast-feed me Mom?! You aint got no tits! Waah wahh!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head Bang!

my name is rockstar remixCause sometimes you feel tiredfeel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up.
But you gotta search within you you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.
Till I collapse Im spilling these raps long as you feel em
Till the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killing them
Cause when I am not then I am stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and Im just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when Im stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the yelling to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out cant shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
Im a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out cant shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
Im a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Music is like magic theres a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause Im at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list heres the order of my list that its in.
It goes Reggie Jay-Z Tupac and Biggie Andre from Outcast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me.
But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy so when Im not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
Thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect youve got to give me
The presss wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out cant shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
Im a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out cant shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
Im a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Soon as a starts I eat it at MCs heart
what is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
Ill probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
Thats why Im clever when I put together every
My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers.
But I dont want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack Im launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if Im not the baddest.
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out cant shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
Im a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out cant shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
Im a rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out from underneath me
I will not fallI will stand tallFeels like no one could beat me
until i collapseWhat tup
I gotta tell you motherfuckers the truth
This is straight G shit
And all you can do is respect it
Swifty
Well Ima state my name Swift McVay

Chorus

Outro
And there you have it god damnit the fundamentals of pimpin
You heard it here first from the Dirtiest Dozen
you ever seen in yo god damn life
Yo this is Rondell Fiend on the scene
And we keep the pussyholes smilin because we always whylin
YouknowhatImsayin? Fuck all what everybody else talkin about
We let you know right here
Big pimpin it aint dead we love gettin head in a dirty-ass bed
Thats just what we do
You know we was throwin heroin pimp parties back in 
The pussy is all great
Ill see you at eight bitch
pimp like meYou still love me?
take this. you ready? . . ! the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me and i love you more.
its sick but who could ever predict
wed be doin the same shit
we say we do it for our baby but we dont
we do it for us its lust
cuz neither one of us trusts each other
so we fuck til we bust
then we cuss each other out
we know what its about
shout til i throw you out the house
you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch
punch you in the mouth
fist fight til we turn this mother out
and apologize after
laughter pain its insane
were back in the same chapter again
and its sad but its true
when im layin here with you
there aint nothin anyone could ever say ever do.
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me and i love you more.
cuz i hate you do you hate me?
good cuz youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry
it makes me wanna just take you
and just throw you on the bed
and fuck you like i dont even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you a slut but im equal im a mutt
were both evil in our ways
but neither one of us would ever admit it
cuz one of us would have one up on the other
so forget it
we can make accusations people spread rumors
but they aint got proof
til they do its just the two of us
its you and me cuz any chick can say that shes screwin me
but you gotta believe me to a degree
cuz if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin it
yeah i would cuz the sex is too damn good
if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm
so its off and on usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
youre the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope
is cuz of that fact
and plus i can bust in that
and thats why...
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me and i love you more.
I could never understand it
thats why i dont try
from junior high until we both die
its silly ho why must we try
is it really so rough
that we must always call each others billy goats gruff
try to pull each others legs
until the other begs
were liein to ourselves
thats the beauty of it yeah
cuz we truly love each other
thats why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other
every other fuckin night
and its clear it aint gonna change
its pent up rage
we both have
we both feel like weve been upstaged by someone else
weve both been
someone elses someone else
problem is neither one wants help
its an addiction and it cant be fixed
our familys mixed up
theres a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit
and theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time
on every song every lyric and every rhyme
all the hoopla all of the whoopdy whoop
what you put me through fuckin whoopdy doo
but i wont be made a fool of
if this is true love
you wouldnt do what
you did last time
you wouldnt screw up
this time
cuz this time girl
im tellin you what
you do it again im fuckin you up
no matter what...
what you say what you do
ima hunt you down til i find you
no matter where you run ill be right there
right behind you in your nightmares
all the flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
you say you hate me you gon hate me more
when you find out you cant escape me whore.
the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cuz you love me and i love you more.
i love you moreIntro

Hi kids!
Do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try acid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
My brains dead weight Im tryin to get my head straight
But I cant figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
Slim Shady you a base-head!
Uh-uh!
So whys your face red? Man you wasted!
Well since age twelve Ive felt like Im someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lees tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
Come here slut!

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester Ill be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin at me
Lets just be friends!
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her Id grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it
Dear Dave thanks for the support asshole!

This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre dont just stand there operate!
Im not ready to leave its too scary to die
Ill have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin or goin?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka
Dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk Ill fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You aint got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
Im steamin mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

You can hear em holla Goon Squad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Good Squad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Runyon Ave. in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I aint got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky
Ima dial  like a mufuckin punk fuck that bla bla
Ima call that rude boy from Detroit Trick Trick
Quick come pick me up bring them guns
Come to the club meet me out front
Theres some chump up in this bitch
Poppin some junk cuz hes drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
Cuz uh somethin smells a lil fishy
And I dont like the way his boys keep lookin at me
So homie come get me Shut up boys what up though I see you

Marshall call me ? and laced the track
This the beat you hear it bangin he produced it himself
My bad almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick head of the Goon Squad
And gangsta been bangin the underground since  were bangin
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me you just didnt know it was me
All the treacherous evil deeds of the D you ever see
Pickin that kid up in the game I just wasnt chasin the fame
I been chasin the paper product and givin lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin a murder rap
And my boy holdin me up Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem Detroit back in the house
Wheres my gangstas and all my thugs?

I been whippin on mothafuckas for the longest time
So its evident its time for Trick to get it fast
The public see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldnt keep up
Got a fanbase thats bigger than an average star
Im satisfied with it bein my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I aint sayin the shit that Im sayin so girls can feel me
Only speakin on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner

welcome to detroitWarning this shits gon be rated R restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? Its self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma Bitch you got a sick kid
Arrested molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
Im Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
Murder murder Redrum
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated till my stress is elevated
How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?
Illiterate illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littleer
Smoke a blunt while Im titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Yall thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didnt Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon fit in her
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I lace tunes Im out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits dip shits
Doing whip pits passed out like Sanford snip pits
Wheres the weed I wanna tamper with it
Ima let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her cant forget it
Fuck it maybe Im a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what Im on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch what the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip theres a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mamas chapped lips
Slap hips support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
Im just joking is Dirty Dozens really dust smoking?
If all your shits missing than probably one of us broke in
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
My heads ringing like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
Im out the game put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like Oh this is good who sing this?
Slim Shady his tape is dope I love it
Its rugged but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
It was predicted by a medic
Id grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic but I dont think this headaches ever vanishing
Panicking I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen Manaquin posted stiffer than a statue
I think Im dying God is that you?
Somebody help me before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB they dont support no hip hop
They say thats where it ends the closest they gon come is Tupac
Its politics its all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
Im low down and Im shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Yo if it wasnt for your whip Id have nothin to strip
If it wasnt for a wrist Id have nothin to slit
If it wasnt for the shrooms Id have nothin to chew
Yo Im just fuckin with you cuz I got nuttin to do
I am bored
I came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
Ate hors doeuvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers
Let you inhale the glock smell while Im rippin your wallet off
And slippin a Molotov in your Cocktail
Take that
Burnin your contracts punch your A and R in the face
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
Im on some shook shit if its missin I took it
Whoops
Nurse look at this straightjacket its crooked
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail
FedEx
So how do you describe someone with a decapitated head
When the rest of his bodys still alive runnin?
Comin with five gunmen waitin to do a drive-by
So when you see the black  hide from it
What?
For every hundred MCs rhymin about birds
Only about two-thirdsd really set it without words
Yo you aint a thug I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up cock spit you would swear its rainin slugs
What?
Im the hottest shit in the industry
Uh
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shitll end up
Spit a round lift your chin up you get hit ten down and ten up
What?
I take it if you run your mouth then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals cuz of a small name or title
You stepped got devoured and left with a flower and bible
Yo if it wasnt for your whip Id have nothin to strip
If it wasnt for a wrist Id have nothin to slit
If it wasnt for the shrooms Id have nothin to chew
Yo Im just fuckin with you cuz I got nuttin to do
Yo if it wasnt for your whip Id have nothin to strip
If it wasnt for a wrist Id have nothin to slit
If it wasnt for the shrooms Id have nothin to chew
Yo Im just fuckin with you cuz I got nuttin to do
Forget a chorus my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
Yay
And by the time you all catch on Ima end your career
And walk away with the whole floor
So you have nothin to fall back on
Ill throw you off of ten floors ahh
Pull a fuckin headache outta my head and put it in yours
Take this
Im indoors waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me I said It oughta happen
You swallow cum bitch? No but I brought a napkin
Gettin skullie while Im autographin
Got my daughter laughin
Cuz I sent her mother whitewater raftin
Im not a fact Ima proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screamin
Wait wait wait you aint movin here
Lorena Bobbitt cmere want a souveneir?
Ive been high as fuck since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference I need some caine
Cuz I aint sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
Oh my God
Brain implants and they say theres a slim chance
I wont stay the same cuz I traded brains with a chimpanz
Walkin in swamp water with an M- out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces you say grace and make faces
Ill display hate and break you in eight places
What?
Take paces turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim icin my fame blowin your hand off
Dancin with the Devil leadin I wont die Im never leavin
What?
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts what? My meats bigger
What?
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish thinkin Im the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift direct chest hit melt your necklace
For instance you just a henchmen on tough soil
What?
A follower never had heart he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors I see through em put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for
Yo if it wasnt for your whip Id have nothin to strip
If it wasnt for a wrist Id have nothin to slit
If it wasnt for the shrooms Id have nothin to chew
Yo Im just fuckin with you cuz I got nuttin to do
Yo if it wasnt for your whip Id have nothin to strip
If it wasnt for a wrist Id have nothin to slit
If it wasnt for the shrooms Id have nothin to chew

His corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
He kind of smelled a little like Courtney Love

So I stapped him twice kept jabbin christ He wont die this guys like a battered wife
Hes like Kim he keeps comin back for more
But he wont fight back I cracked his jaw

Thats why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I dont go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niqqas know I lay em down make you beg
Bitches try to kick me while Im down Ill break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam

Its an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking
lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I self-started a Roc fellow
When Im not even in my harshest you can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow
Til Im toppling from the top Im not going to stop Im staying on my Monopoly
board
That means Im on top of my game and it dont stop til my hip dont hop anymore
When you so good that you cant say it cause it aint even cool for you to sound
cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit these fools cant drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride you never slow the momentum at any moment Im

And suddenly his conscience comes into play
Alright stop! Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
Youd better think of the consequence
But who are you?

And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay youll be safe for days

The whole neighborhood knows you and theyll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first

So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He cant rap or sing but he wants to do both haha
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year

You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
like I aint notice you? BITCH I had a show to do!
Like Im supposed to be star-struck come over to you
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick

Chorus

Aint no one special special like you X
I been searching but your the one I want in my life baby X
Verse  Eminem
Im reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing Im having trouble when breathing
Its even tougher when sleeping
But theres a couple of reasons that Im suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving you all Im thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that Im struggling to keep in
And interrupt when Im speaking
I got some game that Im preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun no matter what youre wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when Im imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
I see you grasping to trust but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
Im not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me I Love You I love you baby
Cause I just need you to see how much Im eager to be
Your man legally wed your loves keeping me fed
This is easily said so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause aint nobody Like you no where to be found

Verse  Denaun Porter
Baby its all on you its you I call on boo
Lets set a day up so you can fall on through
Well take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
Well start it out with caviar Don Parigne
And then when its a fact we are warm carry on
Well take it slow see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
Its still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one thats rare in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable nothing compares
I dream of freaking you the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play only thing left to say is
When you step away baby but dont forget the Neglicie

curtains upHands up officer dont shoot
Then pull your pants up promise you wont loot
We may never understand each other its no use
We aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through
Black boy black boy we aint gonna lie to you
Black boy black boy we dont like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down profiled
And then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably coming from the dope house
We can let you slide but your tail light is blew out
We know youre hiding that Heidi Klum on you
And youre on another drug charge homie its back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensuewe got that tried and true pistol drew
right at you we be delighted to unload it
In your bedroom walk up and lay that taser in the side of you
What the fuck am I gonna do?
I keep telling myself keep doing like youre doing
No matter how many lives you ruin
Its for the red white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No ones ever indicted you
Why?
Cause youre a white boy white boy
Youre a rockstar My momma talk to me
Try to tell me how to live
White boy white boy in your cop car But I dont listen to her
Cause my head is like a sieve
White boy white boyyoure untouchable The worlds coming to an end I dont even care
Nobody can tell me shit cause Im a big rockstar
Black boy black boy we dont get your culture and
We dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man
Dont tell us your attitudes a result of that
Balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up
We bought to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You dont have to know our plan or what our intentions are
Our guns are close to our chest
You better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
And youll get shot in the thyroid cause you might die boy
We fighting a crime war
Here come the swine
Tryna clean up these streets from all these minorities
Thats why we call them pigstyes for
Theyre like eyesores to police
Talk to you like youre a piece of trash
Feels like were stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and
Get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins
It like were drifting back into the s
Having black-skin is risky cause this keeps happening
Throughout history African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admitthere have been times where its been embarrassing to be a
Cause youre a white boy white boy
Youre a rockstar My momma talk to me
Try to tell me how to live
White boy white boy in your cop car But I dont listen to her
Cause my head is like a sieve
White boy white boyyoure untouchable The worlds coming to an end I dont even care
Nobody can tell me shit cause Im a big rockstar
Pt. II
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice that of a black life-spanner
Wonder if sometimes it has a fight scanner
I feel like checking out on life cant escape my circumstance
Id rather hear them say Die N-word than Die Antwoord
Ninja now its better to describe banter
But thats life
Strapped cause were strapped financially
And cant find answers
Were applying for McDonalds
It seems like the only franchise thatll
hire so how can we have higher standards
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence
But acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes wack lives madder
At cops and cops madder
And thats why its at a stalemate
Cant arrive at a compromise so its Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
The block is our backyard offices
Not the crook spot
Call the attack dogs off of us man
You always act pissed off at us a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for good cops
And man stop sending white cops into black neighborhoods
Cause they aint acclimated to em
Like thats the way to do it
Whos seen some videos of rappers waving guns
And no nobody black so they act afraid of us
And thats racism
Fear to the black face gives them
A subconscious racist
Wait why is there black neighborhoods?
Cause America segregated us
Designated us to an area
Separated us
Section-eightd us
When we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us
And education sucks every days another
Freddie Grey for us a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape
The sirens
Dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies
In
The poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in
The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence
And were trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devils face
Lions tigers and bears oh my! More like billy clubs and
Gats
And we really love it when you think were guilty ‘cause
Were black
But you kill each other facts- you peel each
Others caps for silly stuff like hats
Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
While people with nothing to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck is the boots?
And streets act as a narrator
Dont gotta read comics
Or be that into characters just to see that just to be blackyou better be strappedwith a derringer- or be capped in America like Steve Rogers
Cause no one overseas these cops and
Always see some B charges
We see them beat Rodney King and got off
So we dont need all your crooked police peace offerings
Just keep marching til we reach congress
But they gonna say youre tying to take an
irrational stance cause you try to slander the flag
But someone has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kapernick tantrum if
you dont stand for the national anthem
We raised ityou better praise it or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the bravest still racist spills
So the whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that it was
foundation on based on united states ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singing the Star Spangled Banner to a piece of cloth
that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build
untouchableIt may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man ever man
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown Nino
She insists she got more class we know
Swimming in the money come and find me Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball Kimo
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
Whodve thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal I did it without one
Yeah nigga Im about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness bitches
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man ever man
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When that nigga blow up they gonna build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button what? Nothin
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt
Like they was down with the old me
No you fucking wasnt
Youre such a fucking loser
He didnt even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man ever man
Ok hello its the Martian
Space jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess Im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like Im running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man ever man
There they go back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go macadamian they go so ballistic whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
Hes wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that Im talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spilling
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me hows it taste
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time Im through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever man ever man ever man ever man
forever with drake kanye west lil wayneIntro x
I done figured this rap shit out

Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success its worked for me repeatedly
Let em diss you first and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war dont start a war
Shit not no more we done scared em off there are no more
Victims to stick Im fixin to pick some and start shit

Pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Aint got no more targets shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to death Benzino went deaf
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his names Bush?
Puss is bushy
Aint shit goin on shit I been gettin so bored lately
Im thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth I liked the shit better then
Shit I could spit better Im bout to kick this sick shit again look
The game just isnt the same its changin
Shit Dres quittin Jayz quittin now its just gangstas just sayin the same shit
Its ancient its fakin

Fubba you cubba cubba yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
Im not a human Im a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
You think Im the new Osama press thinks Im the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest to be honest
Hip hop aint been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
fubba u cubba cubbaIve drowned in high from the ashes now I cant recall your laughter
The smoke of every single grasp but ends of whats left over
And the lights in every broken blown our window
Screaming laughing
I love to feel the course hang out
This is our revival

Guns and rifles sharp knifes I like those
I might just O.D. by the end of tonights show
With the right dose I might wipe out this life pole but

Pregnant women in the abdomen so they cant have children
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
Gay-bashin fags with tire irons and ratchets zip
I seen em come Ive watched em go
Versace Whoa hey! Liberace ho! echoes
I might of bashed somebody you probably know
Buncha faggots in your crib screamin Its not me! No! echoes
Drag em out the closet and across the flo
when you paid em a visit in the hospital
Stab em in the fuckin tonsils with a popsicle stick
and sit back and watch em choke
Cause every chair that I throw
people sue me for dough
They press charges on me
so I can t fight anymo
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
so I suggest you stay home

I dont know where you are
Longing for what I deny
Can we just turn it around tonight?
Chorus x
And do you know without you I just go crazy?
And do you know that all I think about is where you are?
And do you know that only you can save me baby?
From going through this life all alone
When will missing you stop
Seems we lost before the start
Holding back what was inside
Can we just let it all out tonight?
And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?
Chorus x
Do you know
Dont look back on yesterday
I believe we can find a way
Dont let hopes and dreams fade
Dont hesitate its not too late
I go crazy
I go crazy
And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?
And do you know?
Chorus x
go crazyWhatever
Dre just let it run
Hey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
Just shut up and listen Hey yo
Hey yo.
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this ... on this earth
And since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin these sentences gettin this stress
thats been eatin me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully peacefully...
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when Im eatin or feedin my daughter
To not come and speak to me speak to me... I dont know you
And no I dont owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
Im not Mr. NSync Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr. Friendly I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty...
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Im liftin you  feet  feet... in the air
I dont care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of arguin of arguin...
I dont mean to be mean but thats all I can be its just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant
And Oh its his lyrical content -
That song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me finger at me...
So I point one back at em but not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
When you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
With the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn on Marilyn... and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where its at
Middle America now its a tragedy
Now its so sad to see an upper class city
Havin this happenin this happenin...
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way rap this way...
But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and its burnin and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
Im so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top on My Name Is
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rocknroll stations
And I just do not got the patience got the patience...
To deal with these cocky caucasians
who think Im some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk with an accent
And grab on my balls so they always keep askin
The same fuckin questions fuckin questions...
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in
The why the who what when the where and the how
Til Im grabbin my hair and Im tearin it out ahhh
Cause they drivin me crazy me crazy... I cant take it
Im racin Im pacin I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get
But I cant take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin by itNo I wont sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole Im glad
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am?
In the paper the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
the way i am semi blendA lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah Im afraid of death
I dont want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look I cant change the way I think
And I cant change the way I am
But if I offended you
Good
Cause I still dont give a fuck
Im zoning off of one joint stopping a limo
Hopped in the window shopping a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue what year is this?
Fuck a needle heres a sword body pierce with this
Living amok never giving a fuck
Gimme the keys Im drunk and Ive never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
Ill stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and burying guns in the mud
Ive calmed down now I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brains gone my souls worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my bodys still being operated on
Im ducked the fuck down while Im writing this rhyme
Cause Im probably gonna get struck with lightning this time
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
Ill hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
Cause Im crushing the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and Im armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your Mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match
Here momma try em on
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives
Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I cant rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bugged twitches
Im withdrawing from crack so bad my blood itches
I dont rap to get the women fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique Im a posse
Kamikaze strapping a motherfucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my Momma lost me
Im a cross between Manson Esham and Ozzy
I dont know why the fuck Im here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck I was born during an earthquake
For all the weed that Ive smoked
Yo this blunts for you
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that Ive done
Yo Im still gonna do
To all the people Ive offended
Yeah fuck you too!
For every time I reminisce
Yo I miss my past
But I still dont give a fuck yall can kiss my ass

The souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
moms spaghettis mine for the taking
Make me spaghetti as we move toward a new world order
A normal sweater is boring but moms spaghettis close to post mortem
It only grows harder spaghetti grows hotter
He vomits all over. spaghettis all on him
Coast to coast shows he blows his own daughter
He only grows harder only grows hotter
He goes home and barely knows his own moms spaghetti

No more games Ima change what you call spaghetti
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two moms spaghettis
I was playing in the beginning the mood all changed spaghetti
chewed up and spit out and theres vomit on his sweater
But I kept chewin and stepped right into the next cypher
Hold your nose cause here goes the damn diaper
All the vomit inside amplified by the fact
That I keep on forgetting to make spaghetti
And I cant provide the right type of spaghetti for my family
Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy spaghetti
And its no movie theres no moms spaghetti this is my life
And these palms are so sweaty and im so hard
My seeds escaping through this hole that is gaping
caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby vomits on his sweater already
Moms spaghetti hes nervous
bloah another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point Im like a mom
Ive got to formulate spaghetti or I end up in jail or shot
spaghetti is my only motherfucking option vomits not
Mom I love you but this vomits got to go

So here I go its my shot.

I seen this one st on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to
Come to think about his name was.. it was you
Damn!
stan radio editYeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When Im gone but Im trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry
Cuz youre scared I aint there? Daddys with you in your prayers
No more crying wipe them tears Daddys here no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it we gon do it
Laney uncles crazy aint he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Were all we got in this world When it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze I know its confusing you
Daddys always on the move mammas always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I dont see us ever being together
ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady I told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise mommas gon be alright
Its funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck em under the tree
and said some of em were from me Cuz daddy couldnt buy em
Ill never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
And thats when daddy went to California with his CD
and met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T. V.
and momma didnt like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now Im sittin in this empty house
just reminiscing lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
Wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
Laney Im talkin to you too daddys still here
I like the sound of that yeah Its got a ring to it dont it?
Shh mommas only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady I told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise mommas gon be alright
And if you ask me too Daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
Imma give you the world
Imma buy a diamond ring for you Imma sing for you
Ill do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
Imma break that birdies neck
Id go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat dont fuck with dad haha

I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that hes not Thrilled about the video
What does he Wanna be startin somethin?
Well Ill show him whos really Bad
Paul The way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the Man in the mirror
And tell him to Beat it because I Wont stop till I get enough
Do you Remember the time
We were watching the Billy Jean video?
Well hell always be that Michael to me
And it doesnt matter if hes Black or white
Because I Cant stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons
And I hope they all fucking die
How do you like that?
And I like him I like him a lot
I want to touch him but I cant
Excuse me Im taking a shit sorry
Anyways call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So hit me when you get this message fucker
Oh and by the way no I dont have a new gun
Goddamn it
em calls paul skitIts like this and like that and like this...
Im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
Im meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And aint shit changed I kept the same mindstate since the third time that I failed th grade
You probably think that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it
I dont promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
Shit why not? Blow your brain out Im blowin mine out
Fuck it you only live once
hazardous youth a cappella versionStep by step heart to heart
Left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino
It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?
It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentioning Suge
And that was just outta respect for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
While hes all over TV down talking the man
Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
Im still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute because
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dying
But now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
The shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it?
Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rapping
We actually tried to stop the  and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasnt going to go after him
Until Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it  smash him mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?
Well fuck it that mothafucka could get it too fuck him then
But Im so busy being pissed off I dont stop to think
That we just inherited s beef with Murder Inc
And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
We still have soldiers thats on the front line
Thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the To show em we love em back and let them know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I aint tryna have none of people hurt or murdered
It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im copping
Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit popping
Off at your jaws well then I can cause frankly Im sick of talking
Im not going to let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause
like toy soldiers single version explicitYo His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now
The clocks runs out times up over blow
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity oh
There goes rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better
His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but super-stardoms
Close to postmortem it only grows harder
Only grows hotter he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him coast to coast shows
Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads God only
Knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds I suppose its old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da da dum
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better
No more games Im a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebodys payin the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my nine to five
And I cant provide the right type of
Life for my family cause man these stupid
Food stamps dont buy diapers
And theres no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems Lot
So here I go its my shot feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better
lose yourself instrumental versionNow everybody from the

Sometimes its hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Sike!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
Im see-saw battlin
But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake
Theres too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smokin crack?
Before I do that I beg Mariah to take me back

Fuck with me now bitch lets see you freestyle
Talk is cheap motherfucker if youre really feeling froggish leap
Yo slim you gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you you cant let him skate with that
Man I hate this crap this aint rapThis is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There aint no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you woulda tried
The only way Im leavin this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically arrived back at my enemys crib with hennesyGot drunk then I finished he
Im every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark dilligently
Im not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I cant stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man son of sam bitch Im surgical
Il allergic to dyin you think not? you got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at firstThought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worstIt hurts when u see ur friends turn their back on u dawg
When u aint got nothing left but ur word and ur balls
And youre stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin with they hands out
Checking for ur record when its selling
When it aint thats the end no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin u drink till u car spin u then
Damn!
U slam into the wall and u fall
Out the car trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funerals tomorrow wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Lets see how many of your men loyalWhen i pull up looking for youWith a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
Im revved up who said what would lead bust ur head would just explode
With red stuff im hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how u shot it like a coward bullets devour you showered you
Niggars if i was u niggas ill run while given the chance
Understand i can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself it cant hurt me just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me u aint worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan to the war with ur life fuck the tour and the mic
Ill rather fuck a whore with a knife deliver that shit the coroners like
You high hype poppin shit in broad day light nigga ur a gonna at night
When The Music Stops
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbours
wrist to razors
Yall dont want war you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga Im a wolf get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more yall breach the more I moves
This hill street this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels nigga
Or make the news betcha all yall move
When the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop
Musics changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
NWA said fuck the police
Now im in jail

Whatever weather cold or warm
Just let you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road
Yeah Its been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If youre trying to get out just follow me
Ill get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em
But you wont take this thing out these words before I say em
Cause aint no way Im let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say em or do something I do it I dont give a damn
What you think Im doing this for me so fuck the world
Feed it beans its gassed up if a things stopping me
Imma be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me Im tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album hes still shitn
Whether hes on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first for better or worse
Hes married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
His gift is a curse forget the earth hes got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe
Im not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just let you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road
Ok quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shouldnt have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know its a rap
You said you was king you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings instead of getting crowned youre getting capped
And to the fans Ill never let you down again Im back
I promise to never go back on that promise in fact
Lets be honest that last Relapse CD was ehhhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax I aint going back to that now
All Im tryna say is get back click-clack BLAOW
Cause I aint playin around
Theres a game called circle and I dont know how
Im way too up to back down
But I think Im still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But its time to exercise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
Im not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just let you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road
And I just cant keep living this way
So starting today Im breaking out of this cage
Im standing up Imma face my demons
Im manning up Imma hold my ground
Ive had enough now Im so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And dont even realise what you did believe me you
I been through the ringer but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
My world haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more beef flingers no more drama from now on I promise
To focus soley on handling my responsibilitys as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldnt lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause Im raising the bar I shoot for the moon
But Im too busy gazing at stars I feel amazing and
Im not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
Well walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just let you know that youre not alone
Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road

There you go yeah yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have Ive been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid thats behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin
Tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin
Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
Look at me now I betcha probably sick of me now
Aint you mama? I ma make you look so ridiculous now
Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
One more time
I said Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Im a expose it Ill take you back to 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I dont on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim Id grit my teeth and Id try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailies sake I maybe made some mistakes
But Im only human but Im man enough to face em today
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause Id of killed em shit I wouldve shot Kim and them both
Its my life Id like to welcome yall to the Eminem show
Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
One more time
I said Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet ha
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessin your mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin
Goin through public housin systems victim of Munchausens syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt
Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach doesnt it?
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what ya gettin older now and its cold when yaw lonely
And Nathans growin up so quick hes going to know that youre phony
And Hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
Screw this song keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be!
Im sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
One more time
I said Im sorry mama I Never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
cleanin out my closetYeah
Its my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for?
Not the expression no literally give an arm for?
When they know theyre your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
Daddy look what I made Dads gotta go catch a plane
Daddy wheres Mommy? I cant find Mommy where is she?
I dont know go play Hailie baby your Daddys busy
Daddys writing this song this song aint gonna write itself
Ill give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother whos a spitting image of her
Thats Slim Shady yeah baby Slim Shadys crazy
Shady made me but tonight Shadys rocka-by-baby
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back
I keep having this dream Im pushin Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming she dont want me to sing
Youre making Mommy cry why? Why is Mommy crying?
Baby Daddy aint leaving no more Daddy youre lying
You always say that you always say this is the last time
But you aint leaving no more Daddy youre mine
Shes pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please Daddy dont leave Daddy - no stop it!
Goes in her pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket
Its got a picture thisll keep you safe Daddy take it withcha
I look up its just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin walls must be talking cuz man I can hear em
Theyre saying Youve got one more chance to do right - and its tonight
Now go out there and show that you love em before its too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage theyre gone and this spotlight is on
And Im singing
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back
Sixty thousand people all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes theyre throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
Theyre screaming so loud I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down I dont believe what Im seeing
Daddy its me help Mommy her wrists are bleedingBut baby were in Sweden how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you Daddy you told me that you werent leavin
You lied to me Dad and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin it says Number One Dad
Thats all I wanted I just want to give you this coin
I get the point - fine me and Mommy are gone
But baby wait Its too late Dad you made the choice
Now go up there and show em that you love em more than us
Thats what they want they want you Marshall they keep screamin your name
Its no wonder you cant go to sleep just take another pill
Yeah I bet you you will. You rap about it yeah word k-keep it real
I hear applause all this time I couldnt see
How could it be that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around find a gun on the ground cock it
Put it to my brain and scream die Shady and pop it
The sky darkens my life flashes the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
Thats when I wake up alarm clocks ringin theres birds singin
Its Spring and Hailies outside swinging I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that and when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain
Just smile back

Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill

Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state

Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan of citizen by stands
But shit is in my hands heres your life span
For what your lifes worth this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and live a nice land
See Im a nice man but money turned me to Satan
Im thirsty for this green so bad Im dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin
I want the whole plot I wont be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description an sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cuz I got a daughter to feed
And dollar  aint enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
An hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasnt nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin Freeze
But Im already wanted for sellin keys
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots they bust back
Hit the square in the chest he wasnt wearin a vest
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
Left the house pullin out the drive backin out
Need a backin out this ladys Jag started blackin out
Pulled the Mac- out stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin mouth before I blow the brain
From out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it mug her while youre there jacked her up
Stole her car made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on Set it off did
Jetted off kid stole the whip now Im a criminal
Drove in through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but Im injured badly though
Parents screamin Son go in and call the police
Tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
Tried to stall him atleast long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
Smashed the window grabbed the Nintendo 
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
And colliding with an -year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese eggs milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo
And I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up Im surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin Truce truce
Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasnt me it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder my mind state
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
Wasnt ready to be no millionaire I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
From the beginning it wasnt bout the ends
It was bout busting raps and standing for something fucking acronym
Cut the fucking and act like youre happy Im fucking back again
With another anthem why stop when it doesnt have to end?
It aint over til I say its over – enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
Im afraid of whatll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit I salivate at it
Wait is up hands up like its  noon nah homie
Hold them bitches straighter up wave em til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos
I aint deflate enough last chance to make this whole stadium erupt cause
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
Im so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I dont got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
Im not a rapper Im an adapter I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floors open if youd like to discuss
Top  in this motherfucker and if I dont make the cut
What like I give a fuck I will light this bitch up like Im driving a truck
To the side of a pump  to  hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen Im hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut
And I look like I might just give up eh mightve mistook
Me for bowing out I aint taking a bow Im stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut while Im wiping my butt!
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut
Cause Im a fight til I die or win
Biting the dust itll just make me angrier wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
Its survival of what?
So get your ideas stack your ammo
But dont come unless you come to battle Im mad now jump in the saddle
This is it its what you eat sleep piss and shit
Live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit fuse is lit cant diffuse the wick
I dont do this music shit I lose my shit
Aint got shit to lose its the moment of truth
Its all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in the booth I spit
But my respect is overdue Im showing you the flow no one do
Cause I dont own no diploma for school I quit!
So theres nothing for me to fall back on I know no other trade
So you better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Cause youll never take my pride from me
Itll have to be pried from me so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me I dont want you to believe
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you dont like me then fuck you!
Self esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure cause every time I come close to it
I just sneeze but I just go achoo then achieve!
survival of the fittestTwo trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside round the outside
Guess whos back back back?
Back again gain gain
Shadys back back back
Tell a friend

Guess whos back guess whos back?

Ive created a monster cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady Im chopped liver
Well if you want Shady this is what Ill give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka thatll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when Im not cooperating
When Im rocking the table while hes operating hey
You waited this long to stop debating
Cause Im back Im on the rag and ovulating

Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
Till Osama comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary vision is scary
Could start a revolution pollutin the air waves
A rebel so let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin my ass
And its a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me?
Well Im back - na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then Im gonna enter in it
Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
Im interesting the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Heres my  cents my  cents is free
A nuisance who sent you sent for me?
Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me

Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

You -year-old bald-headed fag blow me
You dont know me youre too old let go

Now lets go just give me the signal
Ill be there with a whole list full of new insults
Ive been dope suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean Im disgusting
But its just me Im just obscene hey
Though Im not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy hey
Theres a concept that works
 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
Itll be so empty without me
Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

Hey! Hey stop hey. Please stop fuck stop!
Thank God you stopped.

God Ive been standing out here for like an hour
In soaking wet freezing
Thank you so much. Really youre a life-saver
What are you doing?
Fucking! Get away from me! What the FUCK! FUCKIN ASSHOLE!
GET AWAY FROM ME YOU MOTHERFUCKER! GET AWAY!
GET AWAY YOU FUCKIN FREAK! GET AWAY FROM ME!
GODDAMIT FUCK! HELP ME!
tonya skitCause sometimes you feel tired you feel weakthen you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up.
but you gotta search within you find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of youand get that motivation not to give up
And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your
face.and collapse
Till I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em till the daythat I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
Cuz when I am notthen Ima stop pinninem and I am not hip-hop and Im just not Eminem
subliminal thoughtswhen Ima stop sendin em women are caught in websspin em and hock venom adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the
illin to stop amoxacillins just not real enough
The criminal cop killinhip-hop villain a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
your comin with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it like I showed ya
the spirit of God lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics to shock.
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up?
Fa shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen upyou bizzels forgotslizzel does not give a fuck
Till the roof comes off till the lights go outtill my legs give out cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns outIma rip this shit till my bones collapse.
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out Until the roof
till my legs give out cant shut my mouth The roof comes off
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out Until my legs
Ima rip this shit till my bones collapse.Give out from underneath me
Music is like magictheres a certain feeling you get
when youre real and you spit an people are feelin ya shit
This is your moment
and every single minute you spend tryin to hold on to itcuz you may never get it again
so while youre in it
try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end
cuz Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets inI got a list heres the order of my list that its in
It goes Reggie Jay-Z Tupac and Biggie Andre from OutkastJada Kurupt Nas and then me
But in this industryIm the cause of a lot of envy so when Im not put on this listthe shit does not offend me
Thats why you see me walkin around like nothins bothering meeven though half you people gotta fuckin problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you got to give me.
The presss wet dream like Bobby an Whitney Nate hit me...
Soon as the verse starts I eat it at MCs heart
What is he thinkin? Ima have to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how ppl hang over every word
Ill probly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth thatd be the death of me first
Cuz in my hardest heart I nothing could ever be worsethats y Im clever
when I put together every verse
My thoughts are as spurratic
I act like Ima addict
I rap like Im addicted to
Smack like Im Kim Mathers
But I dont wanna go forth and back
to constant battles
The fact is Id rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack Im launchin at em
The track is on some battle
And raps who wants some static?
Cuz I dont really think the fact that Im Slim matters
Im black and platinum status
Its whack if Im not the baddest
I I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels Like no one can beat me
till i collapse semi blendDont kill me!
Hurry the fuck up!
Thank you!
Go go go!
What the... fuck?
The fuck he go?
Mothafucka bail on me?
Fuck you!

Thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin only option I haves McDonalds bathroom
In a public stall droppin a football so every time someone walks in the John I get Maddened

Told im Todd youre the shit whens all of this crap end?
Cant pump my gas without causin an accident
Pump my gas cut my grass I cant take out the fuckin trash
Without someone passin through my sub harassin
Id count my blessings but I suck at math
Id rather wallow than bask suffering succotash but the ant-
Acid it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin mashed
Potatoes so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri southern roots what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner call dinner supper Tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass
Stuck in the past iPod what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core mule Im as stubborn as
Maybe thats why It feels so strange
Got it all but I still wont change
Maybe thats why I cant leave Detroit
Its the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And lifes been good to me so far...
They call me classless I heard that I second and third that dont know what the fuck Id be doin if it werent rap

Keep me grounded thats why I never take full advantage of wealth
I managed to dwell within these parameters still crammin the shelves full of Hamburger Helper

Creature of habit feel like Im trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves God damn it to hell I
Cant stand all these kids with their camera cellphones

Other day someone got all elaborate and stuck a head from a fuckin dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King they spit on my onion rings

Ill bite your motherfuckin style just to make it fresher
I cant take the pressure Im sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin while Im washin dishes
In school I never said much too busy having a headrush

Then I went to Jim Beam thats when my face grayed
Went to gym in th grade raped the womens swim team
Dont take me for a joke Im no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
Im going up over the curb driving on the median
Finally made it home but I dont got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming Fuck the world like Tupac
I just dont give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking telling your boys that Im on crack
I just dont give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just dont give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon get stuck stoned and snuffed
Cause I just dont give a fuck
Shit fuck everybody!

I make rappers wanna turn into singers

Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doing subpoenas
Hell nah you aint seen a crew genius
Murder whoevers between us pack your heaters
Keep it close you cant beat us
While your whole crew treat us like Gs you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rapping rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It aint no secret that your shit sounds fake
You cant stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in trying to stop the crime rate
Im like toothaches Im painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend em like root canals
I erase all trails something farther from getting bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself you might as well
Be within a  to life sentence on linking trials
Horrified and keep on fronting
Repenting and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swifts around vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape how?
Im gonna take this gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady falling in my face like milk crates – BLAAAOW!
Its Swifty from the 
Like I said no one is iller than me unnhh
Me and Eminem and Mike driving down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin transvestite
Still on probation for strangling my boy Jason
Should be taking my medication its  to  Im facin
Last week this old man I had to blast
‘Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady hung her neck by a hook
Didnt realize it was my grandmother
Til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost  pounds I aint been eating like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure looking good
Rob this little boy in his fucking paper route
Throwing bombs at day care centers
And yell Everybody get out!
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a -piece
‘Cause she found out
I was having an affair with her -year-old niece
No one no ones iller than me
Its Bizarre Kid straight from the 
No one no one is iller than me
Its Bizarre Kid straight from the 
Nobody better test me ‘cause I dont wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch dipped freshly
New Lugz give the crew hugs guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whipping -bottles like the fucking Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth crack open a six
Im on my seventh -ball now I gotta take a piss
Im hollering at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
Im always taking someone elses girl like Cool J does
They probably dont be packing anyways do they Fuzz?
We walked up stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted stab your abdomen
With a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin felon headed to hell in a handbasket
Talking shitll get you your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashing in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady aint nobody iller than me
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standing on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rocking the most classic threads
Flashing bread roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs
You can get til that ass get red
You can get til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him Swift you get him and him
Ill get him and him leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writers block I block writers
My blocks tighter ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumping the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screaming Get the cops quick!
And got drop kicked now she screaming Stop it!
Got clips to stop shit rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch Fuzz Scoota  crop pick
Sick of yall niggas looking at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still dont know the top pick

Grab the green from Al by showing him hot grits
No one Aint nobody iller than me
Its the Mr. Fuzzy from the 
No one no one is iller than me

No one no one is iller than me
Its Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 
You have now witnessed  ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
Well lyrically blast
no one is illerYeah
Its my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for?
Not the expression no literally give an arm for?
When they know theyre your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
Daddy look what I made Dads gotta go catch a plane
Daddy wheres Mommy? I cant find Mommy where is she?
I dont know go play Hailie baby your Daddys busy
Daddys writing this song this song aint gonna write itself
Ill give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother whos a spitting image of her
Thats Slim Shady yeah baby Slim Shadys crazy
Shady made me but tonight Shadys rocka-by-baby
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice

I keep having this dream Im pushin Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming she dont want me to sing
Youre making Mommy cry why? Why is Mommy crying?
Baby Daddy aint leaving no more Daddy youre lying
You always say that you always say this is the last time
But you aint leaving no more Daddy youre mine
Shes pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please Daddy dont leave Daddy - no stop it!
Goes in her pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket
Its got a picture thisll keep you safe Daddy take it withcha
I look up its just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin walls must be talking cuz man I can hear em
Theyre saying Youve got one more chance to do right - and its tonight
Now go out there and show that you love em before its too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage theyre gone and this spotlight is on
And Im singing
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling
And I didnt feel a thing so baby dont feel no pain

Sixty thousand people all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes theyre throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
Theyre screaming so loud I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down I dont believe what Im seeing
Daddy its me help Mommy her wrists are bleedingBut baby were in Sweden how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you Daddy you told me that you werent leavin
You lied to me Dad and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin it says Number One Dad
Thats all I wanted I just want to give you this coin
I get the point - fine me and Mommy are gone
But baby wait Its too late Dad you made the choice
Now go up there and show em that you love em more than us
Thats what they want they want you Marshall they keep screamin your name
Its no wonder you cant go to sleep just take another pill
Yeah I bet you you will. You rap about it yeah word k-keep it real
I hear applause all this time I couldnt see
How could it be that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around find a gun on the ground cock it
Put it to my brain and scream die Shady and pop it
The sky darkens my life flashes the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
Thats when I wake up alarm clocks ringin theres birds singin
Its Spring and Hailies outside swinging I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
And when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that and when Im gone just carry on dont mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that Im looking down on you smiling

when i m gone instrumentalYou were a childcrawlin on your knees toward it.
Makin mama so proudbut your voice was too loud.
We like to watch you laughing.
You pick the insects off plants.
No time to think of consequences.
Control yourself.
Take only what you need from it.
A family of trees wantinTo be haunted.
Control yourself.
Take only what you need from it.
A family of trees wantinTo be haunted.
The water is warmbut its sending me shivers.
A baby is borncrying out for attention.
Memories fadelike looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thoughtthis wouldnt hurt a lot.
I guess not.
Control yourself.
Take only what you need from it.
A family of trees wantinTo be haunted.
Control yourself.
Take only what you need from it.
A family of trees wantinTo be haunted.

kids unedited versionLook I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But Im only going to get this one chance
Somethings wrong I can feel it For six minutes Slim Shady youre on
Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen but I dont know what
If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
They said I rap like a robot so call me rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My penll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin and a killin off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
Im an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic Kill em all with
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You dont really wanna get into a pissin match with this rappity-rap
Packin a MAC in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap yap-yap yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing that
Ill still be able to break a motha-fuckin table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period heres a maxi pad
Its actually disastrously bad for the wack
While Im masterfully constructing this master piece yeah
Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well to be truthful the blueprints
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since Pew
MCs get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz Pac
N.W.A Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C
And induct them into the mothafuckin Rock n
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay-lookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy
Youre witnessing a mass-occur
Like youre watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey that boys gay thats all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day looking boy
Hey looking boy what you say looking boy
I get a hell yeah from Dre looking boy
Ima work for
Everything I have never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable of keeping up
With the same pace looking boy
Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
The way Im racing around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton No Asgard Asgard
So you be Thor and Ill be Odin you rodent Im omnipotent
Let off then Im reloading immediately with these bombs Im toting
And I should not be woken
Im the walking dead
But Im just a talking head a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
Im out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common poodle
Im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
Its me
My honestys brutal
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I was king of the underground
But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line
I said on Im Back from the Mathers LP 
When I tried to say
Ill take seven kids from Columbine
Put em all in a line add an AK- a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im
Morphin into an immortal
Coming through the portal
Youre stuck in a time warp from  though
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man oh man that was a  special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you!
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed J.J. Fad
Uh summa-lumma dooma-lumma you assuming Im a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? Im superhuman
Innovative and Im made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you and
Im devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get em motivated
I make elevating music you make elevator music
Oh hes too mainstream
Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
Its not hip-hop its pop
Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it
I dont know how to make songs like that
I dont know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While Im ripping any one of these verses that versus you
Its curtains Im inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh school flunky pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And Im a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But its still tongue-in-cheek fuck you
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
Im asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still Chunky but Funky
But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me
Theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then
But if I cant batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Dont mistake him for Satan
Its a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and dont be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?
rap godMay I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real slim shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real slim shady please stand up?
Were gonna have a problem here...
verse 
Yall act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin her ass worst than before
They first were dirvorced sold her old furniture scream
Its the return of the
awww wait no way your kidding
He didnt just say what I think he did did he? 
And dr dre said...
Nothing you idiots dr dres dead hes locked in my basement haha
Feminist women loved eminem
Chicka chicka chicka slim shady Im sick of him
Look at him walking around grabing his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who yea but hes so cute though
Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on tv and let looseBut cant but its cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
And if Im lucky u might just give it a little kiss
And thats the messege we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a womens vagina is
Of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit th gradeThey got the discovery channel dont they?
We aint nothing but mammals well some of us cannibals
Who rip other people open like canolopes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope ughh
But if you feel like I feel I got the antadoite
Women wave your pantyhose sing the And it gooooesss
ain
Im slim shady
Yes Im the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So wont the real slim shady...
Please stand up please stand up please stand up
Cause Im slim shady
Yes Im the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So wont the real slim shady...
Please stand up please stand up please stand up
verse 
Will smith dont gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do so f--- him and f--- you too
You think I give a damn about a grammy?
Half of you critics cant even stomach me let alone stand me
but slim what if u win wouldnt it be weird?
Why? so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to britney spears
S--- christina aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to carson daily and fred durst
And hear them argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on mtv
yea hes cute but I think hes married to kim hehe
I should download a audio on mp
And show the whole world how you gave eminem head scream
Im sick of you little golden boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I been sent in here to destroy you
And theres a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me
Who just dont give a f--- like me
Who dress like me
Walk talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing
But not quite me
ain
verse 
Im like a headtrip to listen to
Cause Im only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of yall
And I dont got to be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
Wheather you like to admit it
Im better than % of you rappers out there
Then you wanna outkin kids like these albums like
Its funny cuz the rate Im going when Im 
Ill be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when Im hard jerkin Im jerking
But this whole bag of viagra isnt working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin
He could be workin at burger king spitten on your onion rings
Were in the parking lot circling
Screaming I dont give a f---
With his windows down and system up
So will the real shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to out of your mind and out of control
And one more time loud as you can how does it go?
Ha ha
Guess theres a slim shady in all of us
Fuck it lets all stand up
intro eminem curtain callYeah trying to figure out the difference
But I think
I think the lines are starting to get blurred
Im in a strange place
I feel like Mae when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like Im caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause Im mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace Im working at is dangerous
Theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting em
Cause thats where most of my anger is baste
Fuck your feelings I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes Jays Waynes and the Drakes
Im frustrated cause aint no more NSync now Im all out of whack
Im all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
Im going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is Im strapped for battles sucka
Duck crawl out the back its a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking mirrors also
And I aint stopping till the swear jars full
You done called every woman a slut
But youre forgetting Sarah Marshall
Palin!
Oh my bad... Slut
And next time I show to in court Ill be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like Thats sharp how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass youre lucky I dont tear it off you
And jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
Youre so fucking gravy Marshall I should start calling you au jus
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin take this beat now its all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I couldve changed the world if it wasnt for this verse
So satanic K-Mart chains panic
Cause they cant even spin back the curse words
Cause theyre worse when theyre reversed motherfucker
Rape your mother kill your parents
And these kids are like parrots they run
around the house just like terrorists
Screaming fuck shit fuck adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like merits
Fuck that Id rather be loud and I like swearing
From thr first album even the gals were like Tight lyrics dreamy eyes
But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius whos bored of his lines
And that sort of defines
Where Im at
And the way I feel now feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
Theres darkness closing in there it goes again
It controls my pen but that aint me its my evil twin
But hes just a friend who pops up now and again
So dont blame me just blame him its my evil twin
Welcome back to the land of the living my friend
You have slept for quite some time
So whos left Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah F with Christina I aint fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic Excedrin Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol s feel like Im burning to death but Im freezing
Bed ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger my suicide notes barely legible read the
Bottom its signed by the Joker Lorena said I never can leave her
Shed sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch!
Give up my dick for pussy?
Id be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally I vent heat register Jesus
Ever since ---- Dresden it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps I met DeShaun
At Osborn Id never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for em
They were sleeping I made em stop snorin
Made them break out the popcorn
Now Ive been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming Fuck the police like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear
Like I dropped corn
Fuck top five bitch Im top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac whore
And I got an Evil Twin so who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spots for?
And crazy as I am Im much tamer than him
And Im nuts then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no ones insaner than Slim look at that evil grin
Evil twin please come in what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look whos back with a crab up his ass
Like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
And youre all aware I dont got it all upstairs
Guess thats why Im an addict and its so small up there
Peace to Whitney jeez just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause Im so sick of being the truth I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh! LMFAO
Oh no way Jo-
Se Baez couldnt beat this rap OJ no
Hooray Im off the like Casey Anthony hey ho
Hey-ho!
I sound like Im trying to sing the fucking chorus to Hip Hop Hooray no
Im hollering you got bottom-end like an --
 and I base whether were fucking off that instead of your face so
Let your low end raise yo
Tango what you think ho? Slow dancing or bowling?
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What you think Im looking for romance cause Im lonely?
Change that tune you aint got a remote chance to control me
Ho Im only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over it wont hurt
Dont try to fix me Im broke so I dont work
So are you but youre broke cause you dont work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced yall to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same bitch
evil twinI own a mansion but live in a house
A king size bed but I sleep on the couch
Im Mister Bright Side glass is half-full
But my tanks half-empty gasket just blew
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin only option I haves McDonalds bathroom
In a public stall droppin a football so every time someone walks in the John I get Maddened
Shady what up what? come on man Im crappin
And youre askin for my goddamn autograph on a napkin
Oh thats odd I just happened
To run out of tissue yeah hand me that on second though Id be glad then
Thanks dog names Todd a big fan I
Wiped my ass with it crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
Told im Todd youre the shit whens all of this crap end?
Cant pump my gas without causin an accident
Pump my gas cut my grass I cant take out the fuckin trash
Without someone passin through my sub harassin
Id count my blessings but I suck at math
Id rather wallow than bask suffering succotash but the ant-
Acid it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin mashed
Potatoes so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri southern roots what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner call dinner supper Tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass
Stuck in the past iPod what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core mule Im as stubborn as
Maybe thats why It feels so strange
Got it all but I still wont change
Maybe thats why I cant leave Detroit
Its the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And lifes been good to me so far...

Keep me grounded thats why I never take full advantage of wealth
I managed to dwell within these parameters still crammin the shelves full of Hamburger Helper

Creature of habit feel like Im trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves God damn it to hell I

So Im artist of the decade I even got a plaque
Id hang it up but the frame is all cracked
Im tryin ta be low-key hopefully nobody notices me
In produce hunched over giant nose bleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed I just did Comerica with Hova the shows over Im hidin in Krogers buyin groceries
He just had front row seats told me sign his poster then insults me
Wow up close didnt know you had crows feet!

Nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin Recovery if I fumble it?
Cause Im a drop the ball if I dont get a grip hoppin out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision
To fuck with bitch quit snappin fuckin pictures of my kids I love my city
But you pushed me to the limit what a pity
The shit I complain about
Its like there aint a cloud in the sky and its rainin out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch Ill never get it out
But bitch I got an elevator in my house ants and a mouse
Im livin the dream
so farYou used to say that Id never be
Nothing without you and Id believe
Im shot in the lungs I gasp I cant breathe
Just lay here with me baby hold me please
And Id beg and Id plead drop to knees
And Id cry and Id scream Baby please dont leave
Snatch the keys from your hand I would squeeze
And youd laugh and youd tease youre just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And youve had enough of me
I smother you Im bout to jump off the edge
But you wont break me youll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you I bet you Ill be just fine without you
And if I stumble I wont crumble Ill get back up and uhh
But Imma still be humble when I scream Fuck you
Cause Im stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you have
Cause on the inside youre ugly and mad
But youre all that I love I grasp you cant leave
Please stay here with me baby hold me please
And Id beg and I plead drop to knees
And Id cry and Id scream baby please dont leave
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing nothing for me
So please dont wake me from this dream baby
Were still together in my head
And youre still in love with me
til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you wont break me youll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you I bet you Ill be just fine without you
And if I stumble I wont crumble Ill get back up and uhh
But Imma still be humble when I scream Fuck you
Cause Im stronger than I was
You walked out I almost died it was almost a homicide
That you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
Id rather die than you not be by my side
Cant count how many times I vomited cried
Go to my room turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde nah
On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I why did I think it was ride or die?
Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
Its like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the other side
Of my back and stuck a spike too shoulda
Put up more of a fight but I couldnt
At the time no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now whats the likelihood of that?
Bite me bitch chew on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up finally showed a sign
Of life in me for the first time since you left me
And left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we couldve been
But Im breaking out of this slump Im in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
Im getting up once and for all fuck this shit
Ima be late for the pity party
But youre never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So dont lump me in with the chump-ions
Im done being your punching bag
It was the November st today
Wouldve been our anniversary
Two years but you left on the st of May
I wrote it on a calendar was gonna call
But couldnt think of the words to say
But they came to me just now
So I put em in a verse to lay
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me I gave you all you gave me none
But if you blame me youre crazy and after all is said and done
Im still angry yeah I may be I may never trust someone
But you wont break me youll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you I bet you Ill be just fine without you
And if I stumble I wont crumble Ill get back up and uhh
But Imma still be humble when I scream Fuck you

Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society would reap a great benefit
I walk around like a space cadet place your bets
Whos likely to become a serial killer case of Tourettes
Fuck fuck fuck
Cant take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how Ill cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imaginations dangerous
Its the only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation I guess
Cause I feel like a little bitch
This predicaments despicable
Im sick of just gettin pushed its ridiculous
I look like a freakin wuss a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
He hit me I fell
I got back up all I did was book
Now theres using your head
Momma always said
If you had a brain youd be dangerous
A brain youd be dangerous
Ima prove you wrong
Momma Imma grow one day to be famous
And Imma be a pain in the anus
Ima be the bomb
Ima use my head as a weapon find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
Son if you had a brain youd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless!
Fast forward some years later a teenager
This is fun sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week its complete
Its usually once a month this is some feat
Ive accomplished theyve stomped me into the mud
Gee for what reason you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you
Beat down and be upbeat when you dont have nothing?
No valid shot at life chance to make it or succeed
Cause youre doomed from the start its like you grew up on Jump Street
From Jump Street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talkin
In a trance locked in my room yeah but I got some plans momma
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket I cant stop it
And Im starting to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure
Im getting more self-assured than Ive ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch - end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant empty void been usin it more as a bin for storageTake some inventory
In this gourde theres a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange
An extension cord and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
Ironin board a bench a wrench a ore wench an attention whore
Everything but a brain but domes off the fuckin chain
Like an independent store
Somethings wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it
Thank God that I dont cause Id probably be Dahmer
Cause momma always said
If you had a brain youd be dangerous
A brain youd be dangerous
Ima prove you wrong
Momma Imma grow one day to be famous
And Imma be a pain in the anus
Ima be the bomb
Ima use my head as a weapon find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
Son if you had a brain youd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless!
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
Cause Im not that smart but Im not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow I came out on top!
I told you one day I said theyd have that red carpet rolled out yo
Im nice yo fuck it Im out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out Go!
Im bout to clean house yo
Im Lysol now Im just household
Outsold the sell-outs freak the hell out Middle America
Hear em yell out in terror they were so scared
And those kids
Just about belted out whatever spouted or fell out of my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
Inappropriate so be it I dont see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears it wont be as
Mothafucking difficult ch-yeah til then
Hopefully ya little homos get over your fears and phobias
Its okay to be scared straight they said I provoke queers
Til emotions evoke tears my whole careers
A stroke of sheer genius smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah
You mothafuckin - Insert insult here
Who the fuck wouldve thunk that one little ole MCd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy they did flock
Cant believe this little hick locked

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I dont belong in this world
Thats why Im scoffing at authority defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom no dad
So Im non complying at home at school Im just shy and awkward
And no I dont need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
Im outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because Im crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I aint talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him
And if you fall Ill get you there
Ill be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words
Cause this is my legacy legacy here
This is my legacy legacy here
Theres no guarantee its not up to me you can only see
This is my legacy legacy
Legacy legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling
Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father he said sayonara and then split
But I dont give a shit Im fine as long as
Theres batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I aint walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which Ive acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight its nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes Ive been jottin
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comicsWhy dont I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on bitch
Who wouldve knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest
This is my legacy legacy here
This is my legacy legacy here
Theres no guarantee its not up to me you can only see
This is my legacy legacy
Legacy legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that Im differently wireds awesome
Cause if I wasnt I wouldnt be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemys words as strength
To try and draw from and get inspired off em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? Im Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole  and  Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
Its the body bag game bitch Im supplying coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker Ive been diabolical
With this dialogue since  Rawkus
You dont respect the legacy I leave behind yall can
Suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I aint halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me Im a fire marshall and this is my
Legacy legacy here
This is my legacy legacy here
Theres no guarantee its not up to me you can only see
This is my legacy legacy
Legacy legacy
legacyYou fucking grou... Pick up the goddamn phone
Bitch where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasnt at the studio bitch whatd you do screw Dre?
You went there looking for me ooh that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me youre gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake lying slut you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You want to lose two legs?
You try to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you
You say Okay yeah Im cuckoo hey? Well screw you
And Id be the third person who screwed you today
Oh four? Dre Drake Lupe? Oh touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true blue ace but you aint
And I can see you and you make that little boo-boo face
Cause Im hanging up this phone boo you make my fucking Bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late go smurf yourself
You make me wanna smurfin puke blue Kool Aid
Heres what you say to someone you hate
My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought wouldnt shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
Think I just relapsed this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go
Cause I told em Im only driving drunk cause that bitch drove me to drink
Im back on my fuck hoes but a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch is such a broad statement
And I am channeling my anger through every single station its on
Cause a woman broke my he-art I say he-art
Cause you ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you are bitch? Guess its time for me
To get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
But Ill never say the L-word again I L-L-L-L... Lesbian!
Ahh I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just
My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought wouldnt shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
Cause you told me you love me forever bitch that was a lie
Now I never wanted someone to die so bad in my fucking life
But fuck it theres other fish in the sea
And Imma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night bitch on a scale of  to 
Shit I must be the holy grail of catches
Ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name de la
I might hit the club find a chick thats tailor made for me
Say fuck it kick some shots back get hammered and nail her
These bitches tryna get attached but theyre failing to latch onto the tail
Of my bumper to scratch them with the back of my trailer
Like Im itchin to get hitched yeah Im rich as a bitch
But bitches aint shit Id rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me thats what I call pitchin a bitch
Thats why Im swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls its foul but my dicks on strike
So all that love shit is null and void bitch Im a droid
I avoid Cupid stupid wasnt for blowjobs youd be unemployed
Oi-oi-oi man oh man you boy-boy-boys getting sick of these girls-girls-girls
Oink-oink-oink you fucking pigs all youre good for is doink-doink-doink
I got  problems and a bitch aint one
Shes all  of em I need a machine gun
I take em all out I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just drop dead and Imma throw a fucking party after this cause
My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought wouldnt shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? I would feel so much better
Im just playing bitch you know I love you
so much betterWhats your name? Marshall
Whos your daddy? I dont have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap Im loco
Its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
Your music usually has them
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt
Follow you must Rick Rubin my little Padawan
A Jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts are entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and Im also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Cant even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh its on a rampage couldnt see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a  Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard
So as long as Im on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop aint dying on my watch
But sometimes when Im sleeping she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Dont got dont care dont have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing
Whats your name? Marshall
Whos your daddy? I dont know him but I wonder
Is he rich like me? Ha-ha
Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?
No! If he had he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad yeah dad
Im the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rapping blue lights flashing
Laughing all the way to the bank lamping in my K-Mart mansion
Im in the style department with a pile in my car ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense
And controversy is on a beat killing spree your honor I must plea guilty
Cause I sparked a revolution rebel without a cause
Who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level boost it
But several rebuked it and whoever produced it
Hip hop is the devils music Is that me? It belongs to me?
Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That dont honk but every time I speak you hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the...
Its the time of the season when hate runs high
And this time give it to you easy when I take back whats mine
With pleasured hands and torture everyone that is my plan
My job here isnt done cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing
Whats your name? Shady
Whos your daddy? I dont give a fuck but I wonder
Is he rich like me? Doubt it ha
Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?
So yeah dad lets walk lets have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldnt get one block
Without me knocking your block off this is all your fault
Maybe thats why Im always so bananas I appeal to all those walks
Of like whoever had strife maybe thats what dad and son talks are like
Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now theyre ripping out their fucking hair again its hysterical
I chuckle cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles yeah uh-oh
Better beware knuckleheads the sound of my hustle says dont knock
The doors broken it wont lock it might just fly open get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit misery loves company please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause Im promoting my passion til Im passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman going a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas Im angrier than all eight of the reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fucking thing yeah
Even this rhyme bitch
And quit tryna look for a fucking reason for it that aint there
But I still am a CRIMINAL
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time Im predicting this one will go EMERALD
When will the madness end how can it when
Theres no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing is Dad Im back at it again bitch
rhyme or reasonOnly reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me
Now Im pissed off
Sit back and relax homey kick back and relax grab a six pack while I kick facts
Yeah Dres sick track perfect way to get back
Wanna hear something wick wack?
I got the exact same tat thats on Nicks back
Im obsessed now
Oh gee is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee
Wow Mariah I didnt expect her to go balls out
Bitch shut the f--k up before I put all them phone calls out you made to my house when you was wild n out before Nick
When you was on my d--k and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you dont want Nick finding out
You probably think cuz its been so long if i had something on you I woulda did it by now
On the contrary Mary Poppins Im mixing our studio session down and sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the f--k I do
Mariah it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
However you prefer to do and goes for you too Nick faggot
You think Im scared of you?
You gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like Ima sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt who made me put up with her psycho ass over  months and only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah what you gonna say? Im lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly that you f--g had to be drunk to f--k me?
Second base? What the f--k you tell Nick punk?
In the second week we was dry humping. Its gotta count for something.
Listen girly. Surely you dont want me to talk about how I nutted early cos ejaculated early and bus all over your belly and you almost started hurling and said I was gross go get a towel youre stomachs curling. Or maybe you do.
But if Im embarrassing me Im embarrassing you and dont you dare say it isnt true.
As long as the songs getting airplay Im dissing you.
Im a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued.
I was gonna stop at . This is . This is  bars. We aint even a third of the way through.
Damn Slim. Mariah played you. Mariah who?
Oh did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too.
Like Ive been goin off on you all this time for no reason.
Girl you out ya alcholic mind. Check ya wine cellar. Look at all the amounts of wine.
Like I sit around and think about you all the time.
I just think this is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme.
But it now im about to draw the line.
And for you to cross it thats a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb.
I can describe areas of your house that you wouldnt find on an episode of Cribs
A blubba load ribs if I hear another word so dont go opening your jibs cos every time you do its just another load of fibs
I aint saying this shit again ho. You know what it is.
Its a warning shot for before I blow up ya whole spot
Call my bluff and Ill release every f--g thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin to stick two CDs in the same spot
Slim Shady I love you
I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear boo. Now what you say?
Its nothing
Guess what Ill do?
Ill refresh your memory when you said I want you

Armageddon lets go
I got a riddle whats little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
Isnt it Albanian Armenian Iranian Tasmanian no
His names Raymond and oh oh sorry yo so sorry wow
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo so
Either except it or you dont and lets move on
If Ive shown that Ive grown and get the bone
Keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin around sniffin each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
Hold up hold up hold up
New york city man
Its the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin what Im hearin right now
You know this aint no regular shit homy
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green come on
Countdown to
Armageddon
Lets go
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to man
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture dont let em insult ya
Im tell ya one me again this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And cant be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But aint nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack

UmMmMmm touch my body
UmMmMmm touch my body
Ooh boy just touch my body
I mean girl just touch my body
just do itLook if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted. In one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over bloah!
Snap back to reality Oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked
Hes so mad but he wont give up that
Easy no
He wont have it he knows his whole backs to these ropes
It dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke
Hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
The souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms close to post mortem
It only grows harder homie grows hotter
He blows. Its all over. These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows
Hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes dont want him no more hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da da da
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music the moment

You better
No more games Im a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebodys paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I cant get by with my  to 
And I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama dramas screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail
Ive got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go its my shot.
Feet fail me not this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go go

Tried to pull a motherfuckin fast one Im mad
You just hurt my goddamn feelin
And that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade?
Tryin to play games see the saw blade
See the silhouette of a stalker in your walkway
Better cooperate or get sautÃ©ed and rotisseried
While youre hog tied
MCs get so quiet you can hear em all fuckin dog
Whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule stuntin on that ass
Like the fuckin fall guy
I dont gas my Mercedes after midnight
I treat it like a Mogwai
Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
And run over kids women and men
Vrrm vrrm motor so big you can fit a midget in its engine
Bitch give me them digits while youre cringin
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend spend even ten cents on you?
Since when do you think its gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shit if I think a pennys pretty
Just image how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenee-meenee-miney-moe
Catch an Eskimo by his toe
While hes tryin to roll a snowball
But dont make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go yall
Get up baby get a move on like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You wont ever think of this shit yeah honey you called?
Well here I come havoc on the beat I wreak it
Evil I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin chicken fore it hatches
Cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin
Like the Kraken and Titans when they clash
And get your brains bashin so bad
You gonna have Kurt Cobain askin to autograph
A blood stained napkin
Unfashionable about as rational as a rash on a fags asshole
Now lets take that line run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if hes cool with it dont stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I aint in the mood for the shit git my dick Google it till it pops up
Yall are so motherfuckin full of shit that your stocked up

Chip off the old block but oh Doc is BACK

Oh God Saddams got his own Laden
With his own private plane his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
oranges peach pears plums syringes
chainsaw sound VROOM VROOM! Yeah here I come
Im inches away from you dear fear none
Hip-Hop is in a state of nine-one-one so.
Quick gotta move fast gotta perform miracles

So skip to your lou while I do what I do best

Flows too wet nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the 
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on

Oh! Heh
jerk massive trip xclsv remix blndI dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
Farewell miss I know that you can care less
But Im sorry for everything I was careless
But I need you to know that I love you so much
And Ive been drinking myself to sleep my souls crushed
A couple more shots I know Im gonna go nuts
I cant deal with the fact you left me with no crutch
I was in love with you how could you do this to me
Actually I did this to myself what a tragedy!
And now what do I do?
Where do I go?
Cuz everywhere I go I see your face
Its hard starting over
Trying to find another shoulder
To lean on
I feel like my whole life just got peed on
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain
As crazy as it sounds to me its sane
And I like it why? cuz I feel like were still united
In some weird way I dont wanna fight it
I dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
I wrote you the other day and you didnt write back!
Its like that!? after all the crap we been through!?
I cant believe you! I know I fucked up!
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!
You keep sending me to voicemail!
Im annoyed hell! shit you coulda atleast sent a text
But your probably busy kissing someone elses lips
While Im sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!
Youre hard headed a sharp headache
I need help call a medic
I just cut myself yea I did it
Without you Im nothing dont you get it!?
Everytime that I said I loved you I meant it!
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that
We ever met I cant believe you just said that
Youre so cold you just hit me so low
I cant take this nomo so hit the road
I dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
Some things just dont seem the way they do
One day you tell me I love you and only you
I wake up to find out it was a dream
Youre telling you hate me youre leaving me
People change everything changes
We go from best friends then become strangers
We go from seeing eachother everyday then
Farewell to never seeing your face again
I cant get you outta of my head
So Im out of bed at  in the morning
Wishing I was dead
But for some odd reason I cant do it
For some reason I needed to write
Whats on my mind and whats going through it
Cuz if I dont ill prolly suffocate
Why do you have so much hate
Towards me you need some loving babe
God I fuckin love you I hate myself
For falling in love with you
Just to find out all I did was trouble you
My heart is aching Im medicated
I tried meditating
But nothing works I dont even feel sedated
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second
I wreckon you would jump out your window bare naked
Fuck humiliation you do anything to get me back
Opinions wouldnt matter what they thought in fact
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good
And do everything to have me if you could
I dont wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
goodbyeGuess its true Im not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause Im just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I dont want you to leave will you hold my hand?
Oh wont you stay with me
Cause youre all I need
This aint love it clear to see
But darling stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No its not a good look gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesnt hurt
Oh wont you stay with me?
Cause youre all I need
This aint love its clear to see
But darling stay with me
Oh wont you stay with me?
Cause youre all I need
This aint love its clear to see

Oh wont you stay with me?

This aint love its clear to see
But darling stay with me

Yeah yeah I get it
I run this rap shit now guess whos back
You thought I left you now why would I do that?   
They keep on sayin the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West maybe theyre just tryna distract it
From the fact that Im comin back
Or maybe its cause I aint black maybe its because of that
Maybe its because Im the highest sellin artist in rap
While Im sittin back in my office jackin off to my plaques
Im still sick how can I be sick this long
And Im still alive Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin my opponents think that Ive died
Thats when I just pop up outta nowhere oh yeah there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of Saint-Tropez but your man dont lay
In the sun cause I dont tan I burn blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money weve earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 
And coulda retired at  in my ′s still
And Fif here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he aint even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more oh boy goddamn did he score
To go from sellin bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us we make pay
Im just a super easy modest MC okay?
Til I hear the word has been thats when I start spazzin
Smart asses kiss a smarter ass then
Im the best thing that ever happened to rap bastards
Im a blonde Dre now gimme Kanyes glasses!
get to it
